Magelight:
Cost per Rank: 2
Casting Number: 5
Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 1/hour
Effects: a small; softly glowing globule of white light (about the illumination of a lantern) under your control hovers around you for the duration; providing normal illumination in dark spaces. It is not of sufficient strength to blind opponents.
Duration: 1 hour per WP spent; or until dispelled.
Range: 2 meter radius.
Area of Effect: illuminates 10 meters around the caster the same way a high quality oil lamp would.
Casting Time: ½ action.

Alarm ward:  
Cost per Rank: 2
Casting Number: 7
Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 1 per 6 hours
Reagents: a small bell (replace hours with days for duration); a bell made of gold (effect is permanent until triggered or dispelled); a vial of lamp oil (target that disturbs the ward is illuminated by magelight for 1d10 minutes); a compass needle (the mage can sense the direction of anything that disturbed the ward after making a DC15 combined willpower and intelligence check)
Effects: any physical intrusion into the effective radius of the alarm ward as defined by the spellcaster before the spell is cast (for example; any animal; or anyone not already present in this camp; etc.) causes a piercing ringing (like a dozen large bells being vigorously rung) throughout the radius of the alarm ward; 
Duration: 6 hours per WP spent; or until dispelled
Range: line of sight
Area of Effect: up to a 5 meter radius per caster MP point
Casting Time: 1 action
- you enchant an object or area (nothing larger than a 10 meter square); so that if it is disturbed (touched) by a physical object; loud alarm bells ring for 1 minute. Reagent: any kind of bell (cut casting roll in half). Duration is 1 day. Can be cancelled; reset; or extended by up to double duration with a successful roll.

Counterspell
Cost per Rank: 4
Minimum MP req: 1 
WP Cost: varies; proportionate to the WP cost of the spell being countered
Effects: you and the opposing spellcaster engage in a battle of wills and magical knowledge; manipulating and shifting the winds of magic in a brief but decisive thrust/counterthrust battle of minds; roll the sum of your MP; INT; WILL; and ranks in “Counterspell” + 2d10 against the casting roll your opponent made on their spell (with their intelligence added in; and with full benefits from the Iron Will merit conferred to either side if they have purchased it); if you do not have a line of sight with your opponent; your counterspell suffers a -15 penalty; as being able to observe their gestures and manipulations of the winds of magic is vital to your success in defeating them; if the spell is successfully countered the opponent still pays the WP cost associated with it; but you only pay half of said cost; and you gain a brief and fleeting understanding of the workings of the spell and may choose a new target for the spell (including the original caster!); but they may also attempt to counterspell you if you redirect the spell upon them; if you fail to counter the spell; it succeeds as normal but you pay the spell's full WP cost; in addition; the enemy caster becomes aware of your location if they were not originally aware (even if you are invisible; however; you can move and they will not “track” you automatically with their mind)
Duration: sustained until resolved (if the opponent is casting a sustained spell on which they succeeded the initial check; check again at the beginning of each round to continue disrupting it; you must disrupt it a number of consecutive rounds equal to their MP in order to permanently dispel their sustained spell)
Range: 25 meters / MP point; range is denoted by the effective range of the spell (for example; if you saw a fireball spell coming at you from 100 meters away but you are only MP 2; you may still counterspell it so long as the fireball itself is within 50 meters of you; however; by focusing on the fireball you would not be able to maintain line of sight with the caster; and would suffer the normal penalty associated with lack of line of sight)
Casting Time: ½ action

Effects: you engage in a battle of wills against an entity that has successfully rooted itself deep within the body and soul of a mortal; every minute; make a contested willpower check with the entity; adding in your MP and ranks in the spell as modifiers; on a success; the daemon is forced to reveal its true name (or if a spirit; its identity and the conditions by which it can go on to the afterlife); which in the case of a daemon can be used to banish it permanently; on a failure; it takes the damage listed above; and the next contested willpower check it makes with you will suffer a stacking -5 penalty; throughout the exorcism; the daemon or spirit will be transfixed on the spot (although it can still lash out at anyone nearby; and can cast spells at a -20 penalty); special: this spell can be used to remove daemonic possession of an item or haunting of a house or location; but the ritual circle made of salt is a requirement; and the casting number is increased by 10

Effects: you temporarily transmute any and all metal items on a character to pure lead; they become heavy and relatively soft; and any armour causes double the normal penalties it would to its user while providing half the protection; and any weapons suffer a -10 penalty to all combat rolls and lose half their damage and all their penetration; after a short while; the metals revert to their original nature but any changes caused to their form (such as swords snapping; bending; or becoming dull) will remain

Reagents: a vial of quicksilver (add 1d10 additional ribbons of molten silver); a stack of 12 silver coins and 1 lead pellet (double range; add + 5 damage to each ribbon; molten silver turns to lead when it comes into contact with the target; getting into the joints of metal armour and the mechanisms and blades of weapons; and remaining there causing people using these items to suffer a permanent -5 to all combat checks (at the GM's discretion) involving weapons and armour until they have the time to pry off the metal once it's cooled)
Damage: 5 + 1d5 per ribbon; 2 ribbons per caster MP; each ribbon can be aimed separately; damage is doubled against opponents with natural weaknesses to it (such as werekin and some undead)
Effects: you call upon the ambient metallic essence in the surrounding winds of magic; and focus it into molten globules of silver; casting them forth in burning ribbons to boil your enemies in it; the silver vanishes back into the winds of magic after casting; but not before it has discharged its burning heat (enemies must make pain checks; Willpower DC 25)

Damage: 10 the first round; 20 the second; 30 the third; 40 the fourth; 50 the fifth
Effects: you gather the essence of Chamon around you and infuse it into any metal an opponent is wearing; this heats up as if it were placed back into the coals where it was forged; heating them up until the enemy is being cooked alive inside his armour and his weapon is branding his hand; each round; they must make a pain threshold check equivalent to the damage they took from being burned (Willpower DC10 the first round; 20 the second … etc.); limited to a single target; and for full damage the enemy must be wearing sufficient metal armor (weapons will never do more than 10 damage per round under normal circumstances; although the pain check to drop the weapon will stack as normal)

Reagents: a cog from a complex machine (+5 to casting roll); the barrel from a gun that misfired (+10 to casting roll)
Effects: warping the mechanical instruments in an area by attaching wild strains of Chamon to them; you cause machines and mechanical objects to break down and cease working; nails to break and bend; barrels to be distorted; and the very wheels of machines to be warped; any constructions and complex machines are ruined so that they must be replaced; and any guns that attempt to fire will misfire on anything but double 10's; magisters who use this spell carelessly may find themselves suffering punishments of a cruel and unusual nature; as the members of the Gold Order do not take lightly to their (relatively) good reputation being ruined at the whims of errant mages.

Effects: you alter an item of relatively low quality or value to appear as if it were of exceptional quality or value; a rusted dagger becomes gilded at the hilt and razor sharp; and polished to a sheen; an old broken wooden clock would turn into a pewter and silver masterpiece complete with a cuckoo crowing on the hour; up to 10 coins per caster MP will become freshly minted marks of higher denomination; this spell is not an illusion but rather a temporary transmutation; but strangely enough magisters have noticed that any sharp knocks or jolts given to said objects will cause them to revert back to their original form (for example; if one were to swing a masterwork broadsword that was enchanted with “fools gold” and was in reality rusted and useless; they would notice that it had reverted to its original form; this is also one of the reasons why apprentices of the Gold Order are discouraged from attempting to cheat merchants of their wares using worthless coins; because apart from the obvious ruin it would bring to the good name of the order; most merchants bite gold coins to determine if they are made of wax or mixed with lesser base metals regardless)

WP Cost: 2
Reagents: a lens (+5 to intelligence checks made later to recall information); a blank book of high quality; with a quill and plenty of ink (allows you the full history of an object; including it's intended use; this will all be written down in the book; taking often up to an hour; for example; a key would include the locksmith who made it; the location of his shop; the metal used in its creation and where it was mined; the time and date of its creation; and a description and diagram of the lock it is intended to unlock; the quill and ink are consumed but the book remains; and it will be filled out in full i.e. all pages used up; the more information the tighter the script and smaller the letters; if anyone cares about that shit)

Any who are caught within double it's effective radius suffer a -5 to their movement speed and initiative checks for the next 5 rounds as their will to live is sapped away into the aethyr. Those who succeed their initiative checks are required to expend their next actions running away from the spell to avoid it's touch; initiative is them reacting in time to flee the spell's effective radius. Due to the inherent power of this spell; all wizards within a 5km radius are aware of the disturbance caused by The Purple Sun of Xereus; and non-amethyst magic cast in the area suffers a -5 penalty for the next month.
