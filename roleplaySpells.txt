If a 1 is rolled, the spell may be cancelled before it’s effects take hold by spending a fate point.)
Effects: Mental Shielding prepares you for the worst of what's ahead by giving you a +5 bonus to resist mind-affecting spells and abilities, and absorbing 2xMP of insanity points.

Effects: any physical intrusion into the effective radius of the alarm ward as defined by the spellcaster before the spell is cast (for example, any animal, or anyone not already present in this camp, etc.) causes a piercing ringing (like a dozen large bells being vigorously rung) throughout the radius of the alarm ward, 
Duration: 6 hours per WP spent, or until dispelled
Range: line of sight
Area of Effect: up to a 5 meter radius per caster MP point

Counterspell
Cost per Rank: 4
Minimum MP req: 1 
WP Cost: varies; proportionate to the WP cost of the spell being countered
Effects: you and the opposing spellcaster engage in a battle of wills and magical knowledge, manipulating and shifting the winds of magic in a brief but decisive thrust/counterthrust battle of minds; roll the sum of your MP, INT, WILL, and ranks in “Counterspell” + 2d10 against the casting roll your opponent made on their spell (with their intelligence added in, and with full benefits from the Iron Will merit conferred to either side if they have purchased it); if you do not have a line of sight with your opponent, your counterspell suffers a -15 penalty, as being able to observe their gestures and manipulations of the winds of magic is vital to your success in defeating them; if the spell is successfully countered the opponent still pays the WP cost associated with it, but you only pay half of said cost, and you gain a brief and fleeting understanding of the workings of the spell and may choose a new target for the spell (including the original caster!), but they may also attempt to counterspell you if you redirect the spell upon them; if you fail to counter the spell, it succeeds as normal but you pay the spell’s full WP cost; in addition, the enemy caster becomes aware of your location if they were not originally aware (even if you are invisible; however, you can move and they will not “track” you automatically with their mind)
Duration: sustained until resolved (if the opponent is casting a sustained spell on which they succeeded the initial check, check again at the beginning of each round to continue disrupting it; you must disrupt it a number of consecutive rounds equal to their MP in order to permanently dispel their sustained spell)
Range: 25 meters / MP point; range is denoted by the effective range of the spell (for example, if you saw a fireball spell coming at you from 100 meters away but you are only MP 2, you may still counterspell it so long as the fireball itself is within 50 meters of you; however, by focusing on the fireball you would not be able to maintain line of sight with the caster, and would suffer the normal penalty associated with lack of line of sight)
Casting Time: ½ action

Casting Number: 12
Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 4
Reagents: a trinket given to the caster by a mage of greater MP (+5 additional soak on all locations)

Initial damage is doubled against daemons, spirits, and undead, and daemons and spirits must check against instability, with a DC of 25.

Damage: 10/min against the entity being exorcised; cannot be regenerated
Effects: you engage in a battle of wills against an entity that has successfully rooted itself deep within the body and soul of a mortal; every minute, make a contested willpower check with the entity, adding in your MP and ranks in the spell as modifiers; on a success, the daemon is forced to reveal its true name (or if a spirit, its identity and the conditions by which it can go on to the afterlife), which in the case of a daemon can be used to banish it permanently; on a failure, it takes the damage listed above, and the next contested willpower check it makes with you will suffer a stacking -5 penalty; throughout the exorcism, the daemon or spirit will be transfixed on the spot (although it can still lash out at anyone nearby, and can cast spells at a -20 penalty); special: this spell can be used to remove daemonic possession of an item or haunting of a house or location, but the ritual circle made of salt is a requirement, and the casting number is increased by 10

Damage: 8 damage + 1d10 per saw blade (double total damage against targets with light or no armor) ignores deflection.
Effects: Calling upon cruelly sharpened servants of metal, the mage sends a number of sawblades and targets equal to his MP. The mage may choose to direct the whirling blades at a lesser number of targets than their MP should they wish (they may also direct any number of blades at a single target). Each blade is unnaturally sharp and deals double damage against opponents wearing no armor or light armor with no deflection, easily sawing through their meagre defense. Once cast, roll for hit location/s of blade/s.

Magnetic Singularity
Cost per Rank: 7.
Casting Number: 35.
Minimum MP req: 5.
WP Cost: 20.
Reagents: A large hunk of unblemished magnetized iron (allows an additional target to be magnetized per MP possessed by the caster and increases the strength of the pull from MP to MPx2).
Damage: Variable.
Effects: You cause a single metal object to become magnetized, pulling all other metal objects within range toward the target at a strength equal to your mp. All objects being pulled toward the primary target must make a strength check vs casting roll. Those non-primary targets who fail this check are pulled toward the primary target at great speed, where damage is a variable based on the weight/type of objects being pulled. Additionally, those that fail their strength checks are disabled and count as ‘immobilized’ until the caster decides to end the spell or until they figure out the connection between an object and the spell. Figuring out the connection still requires a character to remove or somehow distance themselves from the primary magnetized object or objects. Passing a strength check against this spell still causes the non-primary targets in question to suffer a -15 to all strength and dexterity skill checks. Any fired projectiles in the area of effect are automatically pulled to the primary target due to magnetization and deal their damage as normal if they hit that target. If the target is a being with a magnetized object on them, they take damage from all objects pulled hitting them as though a being with that much strength had thrown them.
Duration: Maintained 5 WP per round.
Range: 75 meters (line of sight required).
Area of Effect: 50 meters.
Casting Time: 4 actions.

Effects: you temporarily transmute any and all metal items on a character to pure lead; they become heavy and relatively soft, and any armour causes double the normal penalties it would to its user while providing half the protection, and any weapons suffer a -10 penalty to all combat rolls and lose half their damage and all their penetration; after a short while, the metals revert to their original nature but any changes caused to their form (such as swords snapping, bending, or becoming dull) will remain

Reagents: a vial of quicksilver (add 1d10 additional ribbons of molten silver); a stack of 12 silver coins and 1 lead pellet (double range, add + 5 damage to each ribbon, molten silver turns to lead when it comes into contact with the target, getting into the joints of metal armour and the mechanisms and blades of weapons, and remaining there causing people using these items to suffer a permanent -5 to all combat checks (at the GM’s discretion) involving weapons and armour until they have the time to pry off the metal once it’s cooled)
Damage: 5 + 1d5 per ribbon, 2 ribbons per caster MP; each ribbon can be aimed separately; damage is doubled against opponents with natural weaknesses to it (such as werekin and some undead)
Effects: you call upon the ambient metallic essence in the surrounding winds of magic, and focus it into molten globules of silver, casting them forth in burning ribbons to boil your enemies in it; the silver vanishes back into the winds of magic after casting, but not before it has discharged its burning heat (enemies must make pain checks, Willpower DC 25)

Damage: 10 the first round, 20 the second, 30 the third, 40 the fourth, 50 the fifth
Effects: you gather the essence of Chamon around you and infuse it into any metal an opponent is wearing; this heats up as if it were placed back into the coals where it was forged, heating them up until the enemy is being cooked alive inside his armour and his weapon is branding his hand; each round, they must make a pain threshold check equivalent to the damage they took from being burned (Willpower DC10 the first round, 20 the second … etc.); limited to a single target, and for full damage the enemy must be wearing sufficient metal armor (weapons will never do more than 10 damage per round under normal circumstances, although the pain check to drop the weapon will stack as normal)

Damage: 15 the first round, 30 the second, 45 the third, 60 the fourth, 75 the fifth, 90 the sixth

In addition, for every 10 you exceed the casting number by you may determine a magic items properties and enchantments (1 property or enchantment per 10 exceeding the roll), although strangely enough the negative properties and any curses seem to always be the last thing to be found out; items with secret or invisible messages or code can be revealed this way as well, although they won’t be translated

Effects: you subtly modify an instrument so that it becomes weakened, sabotaged and unwieldy, as if made by one who lacked any modicum of talent or skill; double any penalties that an item would normally be suffering (such as armour slowing down a user or gunpowder weapons misfiring on 1’s), and cause checks made with said item to be rolled twice, with the worse of two rolls being kept
Duration: 1 hour per caster MP
Range: sight, 10m per caster MP
Casting Time: 1 action

Commandment of Brass
Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 25
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 12
Reagents: a cog from a complex machine (+5 to casting roll); the barrel from a gun that misfired (+10 to casting roll)
Effects: warping the mechanical instruments in an area by attaching wild strains of Chamon to them, you cause machines and mechanical objects to break down and cease working, nails to break and bend, barrels to be distorted, and the very wheels of machines to be warped; any constructions and complex machines are ruined so that they must be replaced, and any guns that attempt to fire will misfire on anything but double 10’s; magisters who use this spell carelessly may find themselves suffering punishments of a cruel and unusual nature, as the members of the Gold Order do not take lightly to their (relatively) good reputation being ruined at the whims of errant mages.
Duration: permanent
Range: 10 meters, line of sight
Area of Effect: 5 meter radius + 1 meter per caster MP
Casting Time: 4 actions

Fool’s Gold
Cost per Rank: 3
Casting Number: 17
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 10
Reagents: a lump of fool’s (pyrite) gold (increase the duration for 1 hour, double the amount of coin that can be enchanted); a halfling’s gold tooth (+5 to charisma rolls made by the caster if they smile, as one of their teeth becomes a gold tooth that glitters exceptionally brightly)
Effects: you alter an item of relatively low quality or value to appear as if it were of exceptional quality or value; a rusted dagger becomes gilded at the hilt and razor sharp, and polished to a sheen; an old broken wooden clock would turn into a pewter and silver masterpiece complete with a cuckoo crowing on the hour; up to 10 coins per caster MP will become freshly minted marks of higher denomination; this spell is not an illusion but rather a temporary transmutation, but strangely enough magisters have noticed that any sharp knocks or jolts given to said objects will cause them to revert back to their original form (for example, if one were to swing a masterwork broadsword that was enchanted with “fools gold” and was in reality rusted and useless, they would notice that it had reverted to its original form; this is also one of the reasons why apprentices of the Gold Order are discouraged from attempting to cheat merchants of their wares using worthless coins, because apart from the obvious ruin it would bring to the good name of the order, most merchants bite gold coins to determine if they are made of wax or mixed with lesser base metals regardless)
Duration: 1 hour per caster MP
Range: touch
Casting Time: 2 actions

Guard of Steel
Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 11

Casting Time: 1 action

Inscription
Cost per Rank: 2
Casting Number: 6
Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 1
Reagents: (none, nobody would waste one on this spell)
Effects: by passing your hand over a metal surface you may inscribe any number of words you desire that could reasonably fit onto the surface, although every dozen past the first 12 causes your casting time to increase by an additional 30 seconds; pictures can also be drawn, with the size and detail of the picture increasing the casting time at the GM’s discretion
Duration: permanent
Range: touch
Casting Time: 30 seconds

Law of Age
Cost per Rank: 3
Casting Number: 10
Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 5
Reagents: a fossilized bone (effect is permanent)
Effects: you cause a single inanimate mundane object to become brittle (such as chains, doors, windows, bindings, bars, or an enemy’s shield or sword), decreasing the normal strength DC to break or shatter it by half; if used on weapons or armour, striking them full force (or striking with them) causes them to roll a 1d10 for every strike, breaking on a 2 or below, stacking by 1 per strike (so on the second strike it would break on a 3 or below)
Duration: 1min + 1min/caster MP
Range: touch or line of sight (10 meters/caster MP)
Casting Time: 2 actions

Law of Form
Cost per Rank: 2
Casting Number: 10
Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 5
Reagents: a steel rod (+1 hour to spell duration, +5 to casting roll)
Effects: you transmute an inanimate object to take on the hardness, weight, and qualities of solid steel, increasing its encumbering effect if it must be carried, and making it much harder to break; if used on low quality metal armour it is treated like high quality metal armour; if used on a torch, it won’t ignite; if used on a door it will be extremely difficult to break; if used on a rope it will become rigid and similarly difficult to break; be wary, as using this on armour designed to flex and move (such as leather armour or bows) tends to have undesirable effects for the user
Duration: 1 hour per caster MP
Range: touch or line of sight (10 meters/caster MP)
Casting Time: 2 actions

Law of Gold
Cost per Rank: 6
Casting Number: 26
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 12
Reagents: a small but ornate golden sheath, must be of high quality (+20 to casting roll); a nugget of warpstone (negative effects become permanent)
Effects: you enshroud a magical artifact with the brilliance of Chamon’s golden essence, magnifying and sometimes “haywiring” the magical characteristics therein; modify the magical properties of an item; you may choose a single magical characteristic and double or half it, or modify (GM’s discretion) a single characteristic; this spell can also be used to cause a random (GM’s discretion) negative characteristic to pop up (roll 1d10 for severity) in a magical item.
Duration: 1d10 rounds + caster MP
Range: 25 meters, line of sight
Casting Time: 3 actions

Law of Lead
Cost per Rank: 6
Casting Number: 26
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 12
Reagents: a lidded vessel made of pure lead, clapped shut at the completion of the spell (+10 to casting roll); a hollow vessel made of pure lead in the shape of a person (spell can be cast on a mage, but you must beat them in a contested willpower check)
Effects: by blanketing an item in the dull, sapping essence of lead you temporarily nullify its magical properties; treat the item as if it was mundane (except for items that are rendered magically indestructible); mages of exceptional power (MP 4 or above) are taught a specialized version of this spell that can be used to bind and nullify the powers of an enemy mage of similar or lesser power (same MP or lower); for this, the other mage must roll a willpower check against your casting number, including their MP as a modifier; on a success, you bind their powers and they are rendered magically inert for the duration of the spell; on a failure, the spell explodes outwards and all magic in the surrounding kilometer is deadened for the next hour, causing all mages there to suffer -15 to their casting rolls and gain 1d10 insanity points
Duration: 1d10 rounds + caster MP
Range: 25 meters, line of sight
Casting Time: 3 actions

Effects: your body and mind take on the properties of metal, making them strong, resistant and immutable; gain 5 soak and 5 deflection on all locations (stacks normally with armour), and gain +15 to resistance-based willpower checks (can’t be used to give you a bonus to mentally dominate someone) 
Duration: 1 minute per caster MP, sustained afterwards at (4WP/minute)

Secret Rune
Cost per Rank: 2
Casting Number: 13
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 4
Reagents: a vial of ink infused with gold flakes worth at least 1 gc (may be used in conjunction with “breach the unknown” and “law of logic” to translate coded or foreign languages or messages)
Effects: a more advanced version of the spell of “inscription”, this one allows the message to be rendered invisible once written, and can be cast on any surface; it can be cast again on invisible messages to reveal them or to hide them again; Also If the casting roll doubles, a mage can choose a condition where the message is revealed, ie in the light of the moon, or when a secret word is spoken. In terms of inscription length, same rules apply as the “inscription” spell
Duration: permanent
Range: touch
Casting Time: 30 seconds to inscribe, 5 seconds to reveal or conceal

Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 4
Reagents: a silver arrowhead (+5 to casting roll, +5 to damage for each arrow)

Casting Time: 2 actions

Stoke the Forge
Cost per Rank: 2
Casting Number: 6
Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 1
Reagents: a breath of hot air (+5 to casting roll); “hot” air must be hotter than ordinary temperature of human breath, i.e. by inhaling steam from a boiling pot or air from in front of a fire or forge
Effects: you cause any fire already burning in a forge, stove, fireplace, or any man-made housing (not a campfire) where flames are bent to human purpose to suddenly start burning as hot as would normally be possible, without consuming any additional fuel

Tale of Metal
Cost per Rank: 2
Casting Number: 9
Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 2
Reagents: a lens (+5 to intelligence checks made later to recall information); a blank book of high quality, with a quill and plenty of ink (allows you the full history of an object, including it’s intended use; this will all be written down in the book, taking often up to an hour; for example, a key would include the locksmith who made it, the location of his shop, the metal used in its creation and where it was mined, the time and date of its creation, and a description and diagram of the lock it is intended to unlock; the quill and ink are consumed but the book remains, and it will be filled out in full i.e. all pages used up, the more information the tighter the script and smaller the letters, if anyone cares about that shit)
Effects: you peer into the past of a man-made metal object, witnessing its mining, smelting, forging and assembly as if you had been there watching it; this can not be used to give you skill in the making of a particular item, but only the theoretical knowledge of how to do it; however, if you already have sufficient skill in the creation of the type of item in question, it would be easy to reproduce it with the proper tools and time; after casting the spell, you can make an intelligence check (varying DC, GM’s discretion) to remember specific details not central to the item, such as what the smith or engineer who made it looked like, or what else was being made in the same place, or where the place it was made or where the raw materials to make it were gathered
Range: touch
Casting Time: 1 action

Transformation of Metal
Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 18
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 6
Reagents: a charm in the shape of a hammer and anvil (+5 to casting rolls)
Effects: you reshape a piece of metal with your hands and mind, causing it to take on a new shape; you cannot change the materials present within the item into new ones (such as turning iron into alloyed steel or copper into bronze), but can alter the form so long as the total amount of material remains constant or decreases; for instance, a buckler could be turned into a large flagon, or a sword into a ball of iron (the non metallic parts fall aside), or a greatsword could be made into a dozen solid steel daggers; the quality of the item made is determined by your casting roll modified by any skills related to it (such as blacksmithing to forge a horseshoe or engineering to shape a cog), with 10 and under being of low quality, 11-20 being of average quality, 21-30 being of high quality, and 31-40 being of masterwork quality; some items require non-steel components to function ideally, which will be at the GM’s discretion (for instance, it is unlikely you could make a very effective axe from solid steel (as the axe-head is usually the only steel component) since it would be too heavy and unwieldy and would likely give opponents bonuses to dodge and have a higher minimum strength requirement to use at all)
Duration: permanent
Range: touch
Casting Time: 5 actions

Transmutation of the Unstable Mind
Cost per Rank: 7
Casting Number: 29
Minimum MP req: 3

Reagents: a page from a book written by a madman (+5 to casting rolls)
Effects: you seek to use the power of logic and transmutation to fix a broken mind; on a success, you remove 1d10 insanity points from your “patient”, but on a fail you add 1d10 insanity points instead; additionally, a maximum of 10 insanity points may be removed per caster MP, as some minds are just too far-gone to save; every 10 points removed this way can be used to reduce the DC on Willpower checks for a specific mental flaw by half, and the flaw can be bought off for half the listed xp value (rather than double the listed value, as normal); additionally, by peering into someone’s mind this way, you gain a better understanding of them as a whole (equivalent to in-game knowledge of most of someone’s character sheet, with contested willpower checks to resist revealing specific pieces of information), but may cause you to become a little unhinged yourself (roll a separate 1d10 every time you cast this spell, and on a 1 you gain 1d10 insanity points); spell may be cast multiple times but cannot remove more than the listed limits of insanity points per caster MP
Duration: permanent
Range: touch
Casting Time: 1 hour - 10 minutes per caster MP

Effects: The caster cracks the earth below a select area, causing vicious spikes to burst forth and impale any standing upon the surface.

Each spike has a length equal to 8 meters and a width of 1 meter. Survivors of the spell that are impaled take 1d10 stacking bleeding damage per round until healing or first aid is applied to their wound.

Damage: 10 + 2d10 per strike per tree
Effects: Trees have long and wrathful memories, needing only a little magical encouragement to lash out with root and branch.

Cost per Rank: 3
Casting Number: 14
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 5
Reagents: a bottle full of mud harvested during a flood (+5 to casting roll); an even mix of fresh blood and very fine sand (the mire turns to quicksand, causing the person trapped in it to check for suffocation (Strength, base DC 20, stacks by 5 per round), after rounds equal to their strength; alternately, a willpower check with DC 30 allows the target to relax and hold their breath; they will sink deeper, but can hold out for minutes equal to their strength; after failing a suffocation check, they will die in rounds equal to their strength)
Effects: the wizard gathers the essence of water from a nearby source and sends it beneath a foe, causing them to become trapped in a mudhole; so long as the target is nearby a river, stream, bog, pond, lake, or waterway, the ground beneath and around him turns to a chest-height mire of mud, reducing max movement to ¼ normal; can be cast on multiple targets at once, max 1 additional target per caster MP, so long as all targets are also within range of the water source. A water source created by casting Geyser can be used for this spell.

Damage: 15 + 2d10 per round
Effects: A brutal curse reserved for heinous foes utterly undeserving of the gift of life, the caster causes a mess of thorns to rapidly grow inside his enemy’s body, rapidly bringing about agonizing exsanguination.

Duration: maintained at 5WP per round
Range: 10m, line of sight
Casting Time: 3 actions

Reagents: a key made of clay (+5 to casting roll), the tip of a stalagmite from a cave where human sacrifice occurred (double range; you can emerge underneath an opponent encased in an earthen spike, impaling them; deals 30 damage with penetration 8)
Effects: the caster sinks into the earth or stone, re-appearing nearby at a location of his choice; transit takes 1 full round, and the point of departure and arrival must be of natural earth or stone unshaped by mankind; for instance, it could be cast upon the side of a mountain, but not on a cobblestone path or a dirt road, and not inside a castle or building.

Effects: Tapping into the Winds of Magic, the Wizard creates a charm of healing that bestows great resilience upon himself and his companions. While under the effects of this spell, the caster and his nearby allies regenerate 2 HP per caster MP per round. However, due to the need to maintain a careful connection to the earth, the caster is limited to moving at max ¼ his normal speed while maintaining this spell. Cannot be cast unless walking on natural, undisturbed or cultivated earth, stone, or water (for example, could not be cast inside a dungeon)
Duration: maintained, 5 per round

WP Cost: 5 per target
Reagents: a squirrel’s nuts/HIS BALLS IS NO PROBLEM (+5 to casting roll)
Effects: as animals fatten up for winter and plants store their nutrients in swollen roots and tubers, so does the wizard gather and store the energy of Ghyran, fattening his belly and infusing him with vitality; those touched by the spell need not eat for the next week, and gain temporary bonus HP equal to (5 x caster MP) + spell ranks; spell cannot be stacked.

Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 3
Reagents: a pinch of yeast (the beverage will foam and overflow, yielding 5x the liquid volume originally present)
Effects: mumbling incantations of merriment and inebriation, the wizard can turn water to wine (or even better - beer!). Convert any contained body of liquid not exceeding 1 liter per caster MP into a mildly fermented beverage of your choice (alcohol content ranging from 2-16%, examples being beer, wine, ale, mead, etc.); cannot be used to create spirits directly. Unconsumed liquids revert back to their original state after 24 hours. Can be used on brackish or foul water, even on poisoned substances (rendering them harmless).

Flesh of Clay
Cost per Rank: 6
Casting Number: 29
Minimum MP req: 4
WP Cost: 15
Reagents: a small clay sculpture of you (+5 to casting roll)
Effects: your flesh takes on the aspect of clay, becoming soft and pliable and allowing you to fit through small holes and cracks, or to reshape your body; in addition, damage dealt to you is not lethal, and you can regain up to 20HP per turn by reforming yourself (and regain any lost “clay-flesh” knocked off of you by touching it and reabsorbing it); you also gain a specialized brawl attack allowing you to engulf an opponent’s head, causing them to check for suffocation (strength check with DC 25 stacking by 5 per round, for rounds equal to the opponent’s strength; they die if they remain smothered by your clay-form for additional rounds equal to their strength after failing a strength check). Unfortunately, heavy loads and equipment cannot be carried or manipulated while under the influence of this spell, and movement is reduced to half normal rate. Also, if the spell is interrupted while you are damaged, you will bleed as if you had wounds equivalent to the damage your clay form had when the spell ended, and any missing limbs will be permanent.
Duration: sustained at 5WP per round
Range: self
Casting Time: 3 actions

Stoneskin
Cost per Rank: 5
Casting Number: 25
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 25 + 5 per additional target
Reagents: a polished stone from the bottom of a fast flowing river (+5 to casting roll); a shard from a petrified victim of a cockatrice (stoneskin becomes permanent; however, if the one “cursed” with it stops moving for more than 12 hours, they will turn to solid rock and die)
Effects: The Wizard transmutes his allies’ mortal form to unyielding rock. They gain a passive soak of 10 and deflection of 5 on all locations, and brawling base damage is multiplied by 2, ignores deflection and is treated as if it had impact. However, initiative, dodge, and movement are all reduced to half their normal values (excepting characters with strength 5 or higher). In addition to this, all characters with stoneskin will sink like stones in water. Those who choose to resist the spell may take a contested willpower check vs the caster, with the caster using their willpower, MP and spell ranks as additional modifiers
Duration: minutes equal to caster MP
Range: self
Area of Effect: 15m radius
Casting Time: 2 actions

Flesh to Stone
Cost per Rank: 6
Casting Number: 32
Minimum MP req: 4
WP Cost: 30
Reagents: a cockatrice’s eye (+10 to casting number, spell becomes eyesight based, with any who meet your gaze suffering the effects of the spell, and lasts for minutes equal to 5 x your MP; it can also still be cast free of charge on any opponents within the normal range); a high quality stone figurine of a humanoid (+10 to casting number)
Effects: focusing the steady coldness of stone into his foe, the wizard petrifies them; make a contested willpower check including your MP, willpower, and spell ranks as modifiers; on a success, you turn your opponent to stone, essentially killing them outright (although they will remain technically alive and conscious for 1 day before dying). This spell can be used in reverse to revert those petrified by you or any similar magical process (such as victims of a cockatrice), although naturally this will be useless if they have already expired in their stony prison, or if they have been shattered. Targets with forms larger than that of a human are more difficult to petrify, generally gaining a +10 modifier to their contested willpower check for every time they double the size of an average human (although this works in reverse too, making it very easy to petrify smaller creatures).
Duration: 1 week, upon which the target will revert back to flesh (but be long dead).
Range: 5m, line of sight
Casting Time: 4 actions

Geyser
Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 16
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 5
Reagents: a dowsing rod blessed by a priest of Taal (+10 to casting number, +2d10 damage); a stone gathered from the bottom of a waterfall (+5 to casting number, +1d10 to damage and flying distance); a vial of water collected from a naturally occurring geyser or volcanic hotspring (+20 base damage, as the water is boiling hot and comes forth with incredible force)
Damage: 1d10
Effects: gathering the bursting life energies of Ghyran into a powerful torrent, the wizard unleashes it beneath the feet of his foes, blasting them skywards as a powerful geyser of water erupts forth; the spout emerges from a source of natural earth or stone (for example, you could cast it in a city, but if there were sewers below you then it would emerge from the base of the sewer, and not necessarily burst through the sewer ceiling; similarly, if you were standing on a castle wall, it would emerge at any point on the ground inside the castle, but not from the wall itself); enemies within the AOE take damage from being struck and are then are sent flying through the air 1d10 meters, taking additional falling damage as determined by the GM depending on the situation and the size and strength of the foe; upon being struck, they are also overwhelmed by the force of Ghyran rushing around them, and must make a willpower or strength check with DC 20 or be stunned for 1d5 rounds. For the next hour, a body of freshwater forms where the geyser emerged, equivalent in size to a small pond (this water counts as a natural water source for the purposes of spellcasting).

Reagents: a freshly plucked leaf from the top of a large tree (+5 to casting roll); a fistful of stinging nettles, held in a bare palm (any who engage in melee are struck by a stinging, biting powder that inflicts painful itching on them, causing a willpower check with DC 20 required to do anything other than itch themselves for the next 1d10 rounds; repeated exposure for rounds equal to the opponent’s strength will render them blind for 1d10 hours.
Effects: The caster conjures forth a swirling vortex of leaves around him, concealing his form from his enemies and causing leaves to swirl and slap into the faces of those who seek to engage him. Although the caster can see fine through the leaves, those attempting to hit him with ranged weapons must roll 1d10; on a 1-5, they miss (exceptions being blunderbusses and other wide-spray type weapons, which only miss on a 1-2); also, melee attackers without the blindfighting merit (or similar) suffer a -5 penalty when engaging the wizard in close combat, due to the tendency of the leaves to fly up into their face and obscure their vision.
Duration: sustained at 1WP per round

Cures contagion, so long as it is of a non-magical origin (if magical, Regrowth’s casting roll must be greater than the casting roll of the contagion). Can be used to bring someone back to life, so long as they have only been dead for 1 minute.

Effects:  At the Wizard’s command, crawling brambles burst from the ground forming a living barrier around his allies. The barrier can be shaped according to the desire of the caster, and once formed will open to allow passage for allies, but will not do so for opponents; those seeking to climb or smash through it will be scratched up as normal (aside from permitting passage to allies, the barrier functions as it would naturally).

Damage: 50 per round
Effects: Gnarled creatures emerge from the ground, their steely strong fingers tearing at their foes’ flesh, clutching their limbs and dragging them down to who knows what fate. Targets caught in the AOE are smashed and flensed alive (and take the damage automatically, as there are too many attackers to avoid), and must make a dodge check every turn with DC30; if they fail, they are snatched up and dragged below, and torn into multiple pieces, their remains fertilizing the battlefield for the months to come.

Damage: 15 + 1d10, 2 attacks per round
Effects: The Wizard fashions for himself a walking throne of vine and bracken, to renew and strengthen his connection with the living world (and packing a vicious stomp).

Effects: muttering words of trickery and earthly vindictiveness, the wizard curses a wooded area that those who step through it who lack the favor of the wilds may find themselves fouled by roots, and trapped in place; roots and vines in the target area subtly shift themselves so as to ensnare the ankles of any who walk through it, causing a -10 movement penalty in a large area, with a chance each turn for people to trip and fall if they are moving (acrobatics check to resist, DC 25), and for any who are prone to be entangled and bound to the ground by the roots as they sink back into the earth (initiative check of 20, with no bonuses from weapons, and then a dodge check of 25 to avoid); must be cast in a wooded area

Council of the Cosmos
Cost per Rank: 5.
Casting Number: 30.
Minimum MP req: 4.
WP Cost: 15.
Reagents: The brain of the smartest being on the planet (gain no mutation points for casting this spell; increase your total intelligence permanently by 2 when the spell has completed due to accidentally receiving a glimpse into the mind of a godlike being; gain double insanity points).
Effects: You reach beyond the confines of your world and send a single specific question throughout the cosmos, eventually receiving an answer from a being whose intelligence must be at least 10. There’s a chance that upon receiving an answer to certain questions that any mage who casts this spell may gain either (or both) insanity or mutation points with no save attached, as the knowledge presented by some questions is too much for the mortal condition to comprehend. This spell may only be cast once a year, lest the caster be driven completely mad or mutated beyond recognition. The answer must come to you before the story arc the spell was cast in has expired.
Duration: Until the question is asked.
Range: Universal.
Casting Time: 1 day.
Fluff: “Magicians and priests said the path to true power was behind the black gate guarded by dark powers. They lied”.

Minimum MP req: 2.
WP Cost: 2.
Reagents: The foot of a bounty hunter (+5 to casting roll; duration changes from 1 week per MP to 1 month per MP); a prized bloodhounds nose (duration becomes permanent)
Effects: You enchant one object per MP with an imperceivable (save for mage sight) sigil that allows you to mentally track the location of an item (or items) in question using a mystic link formed between the mage and the item. This spell does not allow you to see or hear anything in the items vicinity while tracking it, only to accurately “feel” where it is and how far it is from your current position. Should the item undergo any adverse magical effects, particularly negative influences or enchantments while the sigil is active, your character risks opening themselves up to said changes by attempting to locate the item. Treat this as an activated spell; each time you wish to locate an item you pay the wp cost.
Duration: 1 week per MP.
Range: Touch (location range is global).
Casting Time: 1 action.
Fluff: When procuring items of great value, many magicians become increasingly paranoid over time, fearing the eventual loss or theft of said object. The sigil guarantees recovery or vengeance, though preferably both.

Damage: 15 + 1d10 per 10 meters fallen.

Failing a check vs this spell causes the characters in question to fly backwards a number of meters equal to the casters MPx20 and soar up to 30 (+10 per MP) meters into the air, taking 15 + 1d10 falling damage (add +1d10 per 10 meters fallen). Succeeding a strength check reduces a characters total movement score to 1 to represent the opposing force preventing proper movement until they manage to leave the area of effect; they are not blown away or thrown up into the air and take no damage.

Area of Effect: 15 meters.
Casting Time: 3 actions.
Fluff: You often hear tell of adventurers getting lost within forests, unable to find a true path no matter where they found themselves. Such inconvenience was below the great mage Asuyr Haddincroft, who would often make his own path using an excessive display of power. Conversely, this did not make him very popular amongst sentient, wild-loving creatures.

Effects: reaching high into the heavens with the utmost of focus and the strongest of will, you search for any nearby meteors and bring them through space and time into the heavens far above; then, by creating a vortex of azyr magic beneath them, you cast them downwards with at terminal velocity to rain destruction upon your foes; the caster summons forth a cluster of 1d10 meteors closer to the orbit of the planet, and once per turn may send one forth upon the enemy; location is semi-random (roll an intelligence check every time as you try to plot the descent path); each meteor does fucking huge damage and AOE explosive; sustained until meteors are used up; the meteors land (1d10)x(10meters) - (10meters) away from the desired target (they hit dead center on a 1, bad luck for whoever was there); this spell is incredibly powerful and disruptive to the winds of magic around it; it causes all additional spells cast within 5 kilometers of the zone to suffer a -5 to their casting rolls for the next day, and all mages nearby can roll sense magic to determine what has happened; the College reserves cruel and unusual punishments to those who use this kind of power frivolously 
Duration: until the meteors have all been cast 
Range: line of sight (targets further than 1km away require an intelligence check of 10x(number of kilometers away) to hit normally, otherwise each lands (number of kilometers away)x(1d10)x(10meters) - (10meters) away from the desired target

Reagents: a noose from a hanged man (+10 to casting roll)
Effects: you rend the fate of your enemy, twisting it apart and bringing it to a short and nasty end; requires a lock of hair from the target or a drop of blood, still in its liquid form; the target makes a Willpower check with DC 50 or loses all fate points and may never purchase more; even if they succeed, the price for purchasing more fate points is permanently tripled, and they lose half (rounded up) of their current fate points; fate points may not be used to counter this spell; in addition, the next critical hit that the target suffers has its critical value multiplied by 3 (so a critical value of x2 would be x6, etc), and all subsequent critical hits add +1 to the multiplier (so a critical value of x3 would be x4); the magic of this spell is so great that all mages within 5km notice a disturbance in the winds, and any Astromancers may roll to detect that this spell was cast, and who it was cast upon; the College of the Blue Wind teaches that this spell is to be reserved for only the most heinous of foes

On a success, the target gains 1d5 insanity points, and gains a temporary mental flaw of the choice of the caster (limited in severity by the GM’s discretion; as a rule of thumb, a flaw may be “worth” as many points as 10 x the caster’s MP).

Perphorion’s Mind Poison
Cost per Rank: 5
Casting Number: 30
Minimum MP req: 4
WP Cost: 20
Reagents: The tongue of a malicious royal advisor (increases the duration to 1 year per caster MP and allows the caster to take the better of two rolls versus all chosen targets).
Effects: The caster mutters arcane words of deceit and illusion, wrapping themselves in a blurred cloak of uncertainty that is visible only to those with magic potential. All targets the caster chooses within an aoe of himself must make a contested willpower check vs the casters willpower + mp + spell ranks + 2d10. Should the caster win the check, all chosen targets are considered ‘mind poisoned’ and are much more suggestable to all ideas presented to them by the caster. This bonus starts at +10 and may stack up to three times, giving a total bonus of +30 to all social rolls vs the targets. Every hour the caster remains in the presence of the chosen targets, they must roll a contested check as listed above. Each failure by the chosen targets adds an additional +10 social bonus to the caster and refreshes the duration. If an opponent succeeds their contested check vs the caster, then the social bonus (if any) decreases by -10 for that specific target. The caster may omit all chosen targets within the aoe from rechecking at any time. Characters coerced into doing things drastically against their nature may gain insanity points upon the completion of said action or deed.
Duration: 1 hour + 1 per caster MP, then maintained at 10WP per hour thereafter
Range: Self
Area of Effect: 5m + 5 per caster MP

Reagents: A blackmail letter already delivered to its target (you may choose multiple targets equal to MP for this spell; spell is extended to written messages as well).
Effects: Your mage is able to convince a single character they have said (or written with a reagent) something completely different from what was actually said (any other npcs/characters present will hear what the mage is actually saying while the intended target hears/reads a completely different message). Failing a competitive willpower check vs the caster with mp and spell ranks as a modifier means that the intended target will hear something spoken by the mage that is completely different than what was said according to all others (if any) present. Succeeding against this spell causes the target to hear the actual message spoken rather than the falsified one.
Duration: Until the message is spoken to its intended target.
Range: Self.
Casting Time: 1 action.
Fluff: “It is good to have come to such a lucrative and prosperous agreement with you, Sir Bernhold! I can only hope such a deal will strengthen both of our guilds and line our pockets with wealth beyond imagination!

Effects: you create a short-term illusion that causes you to appear to be performing one action when in fact you are performing a completely different one; for example, you might be reading a book while you are in fact actually punching another character in the face; characters that you are physically interacting with (pickpocketing, attacking) or casting a spell upon may roll an intelligence check (plus MP if mage) against your casting roll to see through the illusion with DC equal to your casting roll
Duration: 1 round, or until the action is completed (for example, if you were attacking someone, you could only swing once before the illusion broke, even if you have 4-5 attacks per round); can be delayed up to a number of rounds equal to the caster’s MP
Range: self
Casting Time: 1 action

Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 25
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 8
Reagents: a shred of cloth from the clothing of a Wight (+5 to casting roll); a tooth from a monstrous creature (+10 to fear check DC)

Perphorion’s Grand Deception
Cost per Rank: 5.
Casting Number: 31.
Minimum MP req: 4.
WP Cost: 15 for the first illusion and 10 per additional illusion.
Reagents: A mirror that has recently held your reflection (+5 to casting roll and cut WP cost in half per illusion) or an item belonging to another you wish to send as an illusion (enables the spell to let you send an illusion of another thing).
Damage: None.
Effects: Your character is able to send an illusion of himself (or illusions) anywhere (or to anyone) on the globe that they have been previously (or to those they have met before) to carry a specific message or perform a specific action. Those that see the illusion must pass a willpower check with DC 25 + the mages MP and spell ranks in order to see through the illusion. Succeeding the check means that any who would normally see an apparent figure would instead see something indiscernible very briefly before it flickers and vanishes. Failing a check vs the illusion means that any who have witnessed it would treat it as though it were a normal being of its type. Additionally, you may send additional illusions (which may be different) equal to your mp x2 as long as an additional 10 WP is paid per illusion. Also, those who fail their willpower check against the illusion will perceive the target as a physical being that reacts to all actions taken against it.
Duration: 2 weeks per point of MP.
Range: Global.
Area of Effect: None.
Casting Time: Hour.
Fluff: Perphorion was a mage of incredible talent, a savant of illusory magic to a degree so potent that he himself was lost to his own deceit.

Shades of Death
Cost per Rank: 3

Reagents: a withered old battle standard (+5 to casting roll, +5 to fear check DC)
Effects: You cause your opponents to see the men around them wearing the aspects of dead and decaying friends, brothers and comrades superimposed over the actual appearances of those the spell is cast upon; all who view someone with Shades of Death cast upon them must make a willpower check with DC20 or suffer the effects of Fear. The caster nominates 1d10 targets within his line of sight to wear the spell (they need not be willing or aware of this).
Duration: minutes equal to caster MP, sustained thereafter at 1WP per target per minute
Range: 40 meters, line of sight
Area of Effect: 20 meter radius around the targeted zone
Casting Time: 2 actions
 
Unseen Lurker
Cost per Rank: 5
Casting Number: 26
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 12
Reagents: the knife of a notorious murderer, still stained with the blood of his last victim (+5 to casting roll, +1d10 damage per round); a hair from the desired target (the Unseen Lurker will attack that target specifically, and the fog will follow them at 10m per round); a pair of razor sharp scythe blades inscribed with Aethyric runes of Ulgu (+5 to casting roll; attacks gain +10 base damage and are AOE/linear, with a range equivalent to the length of the AOE and a width equal to 5 meters)
Damage: 2d10 per round
Effects: you conjure forth a thick impenetrable fog which reduces visibility to 1 meter, and create a malign presence therein; once per round, it attacks a random enemy within the AOE, ignoring armor and causing bleeding
Duration: rounds equal to caster MP, then maintained at 4WP per round
Range: 50 meters, line of sight
Area of Effect: 25m radius
Casting Time: 3 actions
 
Eye of the Beholder
Cost per Rank: 2
Casting Number: 9
Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 2
Reagents: an eye from any monstrous creature (+10 to casting roll, duration becomes days, not hours)
Effects: you cause any item you touch to appear either worthless or valuable; for example, worthless items would appear warped, pitted, rusted, and cracked, whereas valuable items would appear shiny, polished, perfectly formed, and gilded with small previous stones or gems inserted precisely where they would look best

Range: touch
Casting Time: 1 action
 
Illusion
Cost per Rank: 7
Casting Number: 27
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 20
Reagents: 4 braziers emitting smoke, and 4 mirrors (+5 to casting roll; must be set up at the perimeters of the illusion; extend duration to days rather than hours); a crystal prism (+5 to casting roll); a pair of velvet gloves dusted with warpstone (the illusion also feels like the real thing; blades that cut will cause pain, fires will burn, and food swallowed will rest in the belly; one can die in this illusion if they fail a contested willpower check with the caster, using the caster’s MP and spell ranks as additional modifiers)
Effects: arranging skeins of Ulgu artfully about an area and focusing with great intent and willpower, a Shadowmancer can create a masterful illusion that looks, smells, and sounds just like the real thing; however, it does not feel different than anything already present in the area (for example, an illusory door that is really a rock wall will feel like a rock wall), and illusory objects cannot be grasped but rather will allow the subject’s hand to pass through them. Subjects with reason to suspect that the illusion around them is really an illusion may roll a willpower check to see through it, which must beat the casting roll of the illusion. This does not dispel the illusion, but rather simply allows them to see reality behind it, causing the illusion to become transparent to them.
Duration: treat as maintained for the purposes of casting other spells while the illusion is in effect; lasts for hours equal to the caster’s MP; maintained afterwards at 10WP/hour
Range: line of sight to cast (but not to maintain), 20m
Area of Effect: 10m radius/caster MP
Casting Time: 5 minutes

Minimum MP req: 5
WP Cost: 50
Reagents: earth gathered from under an aethyric portal (+10 to casting roll), Crystal Mist Gem (+20 to casting roll, double radius of the AOE)
Effects: the earth opens beneath the feet of the enemy and their terrified warriors fall screaming into a bottomless pit filled with shadow and the incessant wailing of “Those who dwell below”; all targets that cannot fly (and aren’t larger than the hole and thus wouldn’t fit in the pit) must make an initiative check to flee the rapidly expanding hole (sacrificing all of their actions for the next round to do so) with DC30 (not including modifiers from weapons) or fall into the Aethyric rent conjured forth by the Shadowmancer and be doomed to fall endlessly through the blackness.
Duration: 1 round
Range: 80m, line of sight
Area of Effect: 10m radius
Casting Time: 5 actions
 
Melkoth’s Mystifying Miasma
Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 22
Minimum MP req: 3

Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 12
Reagents: a whole intact fingernail of the person to be forgotten (+5 to contested will checks, person to be forgotten can be other than yourself; it becomes the person who is to be forgotten)
Effects: you cause one character to wholly forget you exist; they forget everything about you, including conversations, your appearance, and anything you’ve ever said or done; roll a contested willpower check against the target, using your MP and spell ranks as modifiers; depending on your significance to the target and how well they know you, they may be granted a modifier to resist (for example, a mother forgetting her child would gain a +30 to resist; two close friends who’ve known each other for years would get a +20 to resist; a bounty hunter who has been chasing you all over the empire would gain a +10 to resist); on a success, the spell takes effect; on a fail, it does not, and you both gain 1d10 insanity points; the target will also become aware of what you tried to do
Duration: permanent
Range: touch
Casting Time: 4 actions
 
Mockery of Death
Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 19
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 10
Reagents: a shroud from a corpse buried for at least a year (+10 to casting roll)
Effects: you cause a character to appear for all intents and purposes to be dead; their skin is cold and clammy, their body stiff with rigor mortis and they will not appear to be breathing, and they cannot move or see (their eyes close), but they can still hear, smell, and feel as normal; they also still need to breathe, eat, and drink (they will likely be very thirsty and hungry when they “awaken”); the character cannot move in any way (aside to breathe, which will be concealed by illusion), and cannot speak; if this is cast on an unwilling target, they get a contested willpower roll against you with double their normal willpower base vs your willpower plus MP and spell ranks; targets can last days equal to their strength before having to roll strength checks for deprivation (strength DC equal to the number of days it has been since they last had sustenance); on a fail, they die
Duration: days equal to your MP, or until released by the caster (touch spell, or activated mentally if the target is the caster)
Range: touch
Casting Time: 6 actions
 
Mutable Visage
Cost per Rank: 2

Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 4
Reagents: a pinch of high quality cosmetics (+3/-3 to social checks or change minutes to hours)
Effects: you alter the appearance of a target, making them appear hideous or incredibly good-looking; this has a magical affect on how well received and liked (or hated and feared) they are; +5/-5 to charisma checks for the target, depending on the check (hideous gives bonuses to intimidate, good-looking gives bonuses to all other social checks)
Duration: minutes equal to caster’s MP + 5

WP Cost: 10/weapon
Reagents: a high quality weapon of the desired type (+5 to casting roll; one weapon’s duration is extended to hours rather than minutes); a dose of any hallucinogenic substance (+10 to willpower DC to resist the weapons)
Damage: special (see effects)
Effects: The Wizard summons phantasmal weapons for his allies that shred the folds of consciousness and reason. Victims of this mindrazor believe themselves slain, so they die. The weapons appear and feel real, save for an eerie smokey miasma that clings to them, and the fact that they have no visible effect on the environment; they phase through armor and deal triple their total normal damage for the weapon type. The caster must have at least 1 point in a weapon skill for the type of weapon he wishes to summon, and likewise the wielders must have at least 1 point in the weapon type they are wielding; however, they are treated as masters (skill base of 10) unless they are already better than masters with the weapon regardless. Any opponents struck by these weapons must make a willpower check with DC30 or take full damage as specified by the spell, and suffer wounds as normal; they can die from these wounds. If they succeed the willpower check, they are unharmed. If they fail the willpower check by a difference of 20 or greater, they die instantly from any strikes from the mindrazor.

WP Cost: 5
Reagents: the eyes of a newt (the caster can see and act normally)
Effects: the caster creates a massive blanket of disorienting magical darkness that is completely impenetrable by vision, even to characters with dark-vision. All characters within it are reduced to maximum half a physical action per round unless they roll a successful willpower check (DC 20) in which case they can use their normal number of actions. Regardless of success or failure on the willpower roll, the characters still can’t see anything, although they can hear and feel their environment fine.
Duration: 5 rounds
Range: self
Area of Effect: 30m radius; does not follow the caster like an aura, but remains where it was casted
Casting Time: 2 actions

WP Cost: 2 per knife

Casting Time: 2 actions
 
Shadow of Death
Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 17

Effects: your appearance takes on a fearsome and sinister aspect, making you appear fearsome and deadly to all who behold you; you cause Fear with a willpower DC of 20 to resist
Duration: minutes equal to caster MP, then sustained at 3WP per minute

Steed of Shadows
Cost per Rank: 3
Casting Number: 14
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 5
Reagents: a high quality horse shoe (your steed moves as fast as the finest horses in the land, equivalent to a purebred Brettonian courser; you are capable of outracing almost anyone); clippings from a faithful steed’s hoof (+5 to casting roll)
Effects: you summon a shadowy, insubstantial looking horse wreathed in mist and fog; it is solid to the touch, but utterly silent (it doesn’t even have hoofbeats), and can be harmed like a normal steed, save that it’s blood never hits the ground; it is completely under the caster’s control and requires no ride skill or handle animal checks
Duration: hours equal to caster’s MP

WP Cost: 25
Reagents: a bat’s wings (+5 to fear check DC, +5 to casting roll), 3 feathers from the wingtips of an eagle (+10 to casting roll, double movement of the Greater Shadowsteed), a manticore’s claw (the shadowsteed can now attack, with 4 damage 30 attacks per round with a base skill of 20; ignores armor)
Effects: a winged steed wreathed in shadows is created, in the desired form of the caster (up to the size of a wyvern); it can appear either underneath the caster or an ally or opponent (and can then be used to carry him high up into the air and dump him), but is under the control of the caster. It is impervious to attacks, which simply phase through it; when 50m or further away, the steed and its caster (if he is mounted) are treated as invisible; if they are closer than 50m, the steed causes a fear check with DC25 to all enemies who behold it; base movement score of the Greater Shadowsteed is 50
Duration: sustained at 10WP/hour
Range: 20m, line of sight
Casting Time: 4 actions
 
Shroud of Invisibility
Cost per Rank: 6
Casting Number: 23
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 5
Reagents: a fresh cataract (increase duration from rounds to minutes), a bottle full of smoke (+5 to casting roll); a body-sized mirror (the mirror will crack, but all who could see their reflection within it will become invisible; their invisibility will last as long as the caster’s, at no additional cost; however, mirrors will reveal the reflections of those made invisible this way)
Effects: wrapping a cloak of Ulgu around him, the caster becomes invisible to the eye; the caster and all he is wearing or carrying (so long as it is not another person) vanish from sight, though sound and smell are not dampened; while invisible, the caster can move at max half their movement speed, and any sudden or aggressive moves, or casting any magic will require the casting roll to be re-rolled with a stacking DC increase of +10 for every attempt made while under the shroud of invisibility; objects can be manipulated as normal provided they are handled carefully and slowly (for example, doorknobs can be turned or opened, but catching a falling object would likely break the shroud)
Duration: rounds equal to caster MPx2, then maintained at 2WP/round
Range: self
Casting Time: 2 actions
 
Substance of Shadow
Cost per Rank: 5
Casting Number: 26
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 25
Reagents: a shadow encompassing the target fully (required; mere darkness does not suffice for this, but rather a light source must cast a distinct shadow which is of sufficient size to fully cloak the object); a vial of blood spilled under a shadow (+5 to casting roll); an item lost for at least a year, then found (duration becomes equal to one year or until dispelled even if the shadow flickers or is gone, provided the object or person does not move)
Effects: the caster or a distinct object and all it contains or a person (both must be 200lbs or smaller) become invisible and silent and partially insubstantial; they can still be affected by magic, but mundane attacks and objects phase through them harmlessly, though they can still manipulate the physical world as normal; casting while under the effects of Substance of Shadow requires the casting number to be re-rolled. The spell lasts indefinitely so long as the target remains fully cloaked in the shadow; if the shadow is removed (such as by putting out the light source or introducing a new one that illuminates the shadow), the spell ends
Duration: see effects
Range: 30m, line of sight

WP Cost: 2
Reagents: a pinch of nothing in particular (cannot be air, +5 to casting roll)
Effects: you become hard to approach and notice, and though people can see you perfectly fine they tend not to remember anything about you or what you might have done; people must make an opposed willpower check (using your MP and spell ranks as modifiers) to approach you or talk to you unless approached or spoken to first; they must make the same test again to remember anything about you or what you have done after you leave; the spell is broken by any drastic actions such as attacking, loud bangs or noises or explosions (must be louder than ambient noise, such as people laughing or shouting in a bar would not break the spell but someone discharging a firearm or attacking someone would) that happen in the AOE
Duration: minutes equal to caster’s MP

Casting Number: 33
Minimum MP req: 4
WP Cost: 15
Reagents: an executioner’s axe (the head will do, +10 to casting roll)
Damage: 150
Effects: A ghostly razor-edged pendulum materialized in the air above the Wizard, on his single word of command, the pendulum swings towards the enemy, picking up speed as it does so.  Is the pendulum real enough to kill or is it just a conjurer’s trick? Only a fool would stand in its path to find out. Enemies who make a successful observe check to see the the pendulum swinging their way (DC up to the GM) must make an initiative check with DC25 (not including bonuses from weapons) to get out of the way, spending their next 2 actions doing so; if they fail to do so, they roll a 1d10; on a 1-5 they take the spell’s damage as normal, which ignores armor; on a 6-10 they are unharmed.
Range: line of sight, 60m
Area of Effect: 10m line, angle of which is determined by the caster

Effects: inky ropes of darkness encircle and strange an opponent around the neck; he must roll his strength vs. your willpower, including spell ranks and MP as modifiers, to keep from passing out; once he passes out, casting the spell on him again will kill him; even if he succeeds his rolls, the targeted opponent will pass out within a number of consecutive successes equal to his strength score as his strength gives out after a certain amount of time.
Duration: rounds equal to the caster’s MP
Range: 5 meters

Reagents: the object itself (required), a sliver of metal dipped in ink (+10 to casting roll), a piece of skin with a tattoo on it (object may be of any size, so long as the caster can move it, i.e. a cannon on wheels)
Effects: a small object (must be able to theoretically fit inside body in it’s current shape, i.e. not a full suit of armor) is absorbed into your body, leaving only a tattoo of it but nothing else. You function normally while it is there, regardless of if it is poisonous or magical, except if it would normally be causing mutation points i.e. warpstone or a chaos artifact, in which case you suffer half as much as you normally would; to expel, you must touch the tattoo with a finger; objects will expel themselves after the duration ends, often in a painful way unless removed by being touched on their tattoo by the carrier
Duration: 1 day per caster MP
Range: touch

Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 17
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 8
Reagents: black lotus petals (sleep effect lasts for 1d10 days, rather than hours, and functions like a coma rather than normal sleep); a pair of eyelids (+5 to contested willpower checks vs. opponents)
Effects: make a contested willpower check vs. an opponent to put them to sleep, using caster MP, willpower, and spell ranks as additional modifiers; opponent’s state of awareness acts as a modifier for/against them (+15 if they are excited/frightened/in combat, +5 if they are alert or well rested, -5 if they are relaxed or drowsy, -15 if they are exhausted or daydreaming); on a success, they fall into a deep sleep, but can awaken as they might normally from loud noises, being struck or handled, or bright lights; on a fail, they still suffer a stacking -5 penalty on their next attempt to resist being put to sleep (penalties last 1 minute), so long as they are not consciously aware of the attempt to put them to sleep (for example, if the caster is concealed or invisible)

Cost per Rank: 3
Casting Number: 13
Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 3
Reagents: a fistful of bone dust (+5 to casting number, +5 to base damage)
Damage: 1d10 + caster MP per round
Effects: Voice rattling like the last gasp of a dying man, the wizard infuses a patch of ground with the deathly essence of Shyish, bleeding away the life of any foolish enough to walk upon it; target patch of ground withers and cracks, and any plant life on it dies; a faint purplish aura gathers around it, causing any who walk upon it (or were caught upon it when the spell was cast) to suffer damage and make a willpower check with DC20; on a fail, their movement is reduced by half for the next 1d10 rounds as they feel their feet drag upon the ground, and they do not add their strength bonus onto any checks that would normally receive it; spell does not stack onto the same location
Duration: sustained at 1WP per round

Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 6
Reagents: a shard from the helm of a cruel or bloodthirsty warrior (+5 to casting roll, 2x duration); a murderer’s jawbone (+5 to willpower DC to resist effects)
Effects: An invisible aura of horror surrounds the caster’s allies; only the bravest foes will now stand before them. The caster and 2 additional targets per caster MP now cause terror to anyone without the Aspect of the Dreadknight (willpower DC 20 + caster MPx2 to resist); the caster may also exempt 2 additional targets per caster MP from the terror inducing effects of Aspect of the Dreadknight; terror is caused by the sight and sound of those enchanted (they look menacing in ways which the GM will elaborate upon, and their voices warp and boom, terrifying those who hear them); those who suffer terror roll a 1d10, with the higher the roll, the more likely they are to run away, versus the lower the roll, the more likely they are to freeze in terror bawling like babes, covering their eyes
Duration: 1 minute per caster MP; targets struck are also terrified for 1 minute per caster MP (independent of the duration of the spell); sustained thereafter at 2WP/minute (allies must stay within the AOE to continue to gain the effects; sustained at 1WP/ally per minute)
Range: self
Area of Effect: allies must be within 20m of the caster to receive the benefits of the spell; for enemies, AOE is sight and sound of the caster, true terror effects are only suffered within 100m of the caster (though they still look menacing at greater distances, it is less likely enemies will wet themselves from the sight of them)

Damage: 50+5d10

Effects: You fling hooks of Shyish into the soul of your enemy, pulling and tugging it loose to leave their body dropped dead like a puppet with its strings cut; roll a contested willpower check against the target, including your MP and spell ranks as modifiers; if they fail, they are torn loose from their body and each round must roll again against your original contested willpower check, decreasing it by 5 per round; if after 3 rounds they have not succeeded the check to return to their body, they die (their soul is sent screaming forth into the void); if they succeed, they gain 4d10 insanity points and make a check against terror with willpower DC 40, and take 1d10 damage per round for 1d10 rounds

WP Cost: 12
Reagents: a glass bottle or vial (required), a drop of honey infused with hemlock (+10 to casting roll, +10 to contested WP check)
Effects: make a contested willpower check against target, using your MP and spell ranks as modifiers (if the target has just died and you reach the body within 2 rounds, no contested willpower check is necessary); add + 10 to your contested willpower check if the target is sleeping or knocked out; on a success, their soul is sucked forth from their body and entrapped in the glass container until such time as it is opened; the body continues to live on like a vegetable, retaining no consciousness and only the most basic biological functions (swallowing, digestion, breathing, sleeping, etc.); if the glass bottle is opened away from the body or without the proper rituals (must be opened by a priest of Morr or an amethyst wizard who knows this spell) it is doomed to wander the world filled with hate and terror, becoming a ghost; even if the target survives this harrowing experience and returns to their body, they still gain gain 10 + 2d10 insanity points

The Caress of Laniph
Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 15
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 5
Reagents: an article of clothing from a courtesan (+5 to casting roll),an item belonging to Laniph (+20 to casting roll, targets who attempt to move away roll willpower DC 40 or become paralyzed for 1d10 rounds and continue to suffer attacks for the full duration of the paralysis)
Damage: 1d10 per round
Effects: Laniph was an Arabyan sorceress whose ardent passions were eclipsed only by her capriciousness. It takes little effort to call her back from the spirit world to caress a new lover of the caster’s choosing; her spirit, withered and ancient will appear before the target, and attempt to seduce them; the target must roll a willpower DC 20 fear check to resist terror initially; if they fail, treat it as written under “Aspect of the Dreadknight”; so long as the target remains still and “goes along with it” (unlikely given her horrifying spectral visage), she will not harm them; however, if they move away from her or if she takes offence to anything they say, she will fly into a rage and strike petulantly (but with deadly malice) at the target, pursuing them for a short while until she is pulled back to Morr’s realm. So long as they are not suffering from terror, the target may roll a persuade check to charm her into letting them go, or a strength check to “satisfy” her (giggity!), with either roll needing to hit the casting roll made for the spell. If they succeed, she leaves them immediately, although on a 1d10 they become cursed and she continues to haunt them in their dreams (1d10 every night; on a 1-3, they gain 1d10 insanity points). The mage may choose to forego the damage of this spell and instead curse the target so that they suffer all elements of the spell aside from the damage once per day (she comes to haunt them once per day at a random time), for years equal to caster MP.
Duration: rounds equal to 2x caster’s MP

Damage: 5 + 1d10 per round
Effects: Bjuna was a mighty warrior, so the story goes, but famously never smiled - leastways not until the trickster god cursed him to laugh until his sides ruptured and split. Tellers of this tale can not agree whose fate was worse: Bjuna’s or the servants who had to clean up the mess. Practitioners of Amethyst Magic can bring this horrible end upon their enemies, but it is a cruel spell and reserved for only the most heinous of foes. Make a contested willpower roll with the target, including your MP and spell ranks as modifiers. On opponent’s success, the opponent only laughs for a single turn. On a fail, they must re-roll at the beginning of each turn to break free of the curse (keep the same roll you initially made to beat them), or they may take no actions other than laughing and suffer 1d10 damage per round
Duration: rounds equal to the caster’s MP + 1d10

Those who do not escape its touch are turned to inert and unfeeling crystal, their blasted free of their former mortal shells. The orb can be moved by the caster 1d10 meters every turn; any who fail an initiative save of 25 (not including weapon bonuses) are struck by it’s aura, and die instantly. Any who are caught within double it’s effective radius suffer a -5 to their movement speed and initiative checks for the next 5 rounds as their will to live is sapped away into the aethyr. Those who succeed their initiative checks are required to expend their next actions running away from the spell to avoid it’s touch; initiative is them reacting in time to flee the spell’s effective radius. Due to the inherent power of this spell, all wizards within a 5km radius are aware of the disturbance caused by The Purple Sun of Xereus, and non-amethyst magic cast in the area suffers a -5 penalty for the next month.

Effects: the caster peers into the final moments of the deceased, seeing through their eyes; for the duration, you see whatever the deceased saw for the moments leading up to their death. However, immersing yourself in the memories of the dead is a highly dangerous task, and a competitive willpower check must be made against the spirit; on a fail, you gain 1d10 insanity points. During the spell you are blind to the world around you, and utterly absorbed in what you are doing. Being struck or attacked gives you a chance to make a willpower check with DC equal to the casting roll you made to cast the spell, in order to snap out of it; however, doing so will always cause you to gain 1d5 insanity points.

Effects: you transfix a nail of Shyish through one of your opponent’s limbs, releasing all the vigor of life from it; it becomes numb and cold and falls limply to their side, unable to be controlled in any way, rendering it utterly useless; treat them like they have a missing limb corresponding to  sensation and control returns to it when the spell ends

Mendicron’s Soulfire Immolation of the Pitied Martyr
Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 18
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 8
Reagents: The ashes of a being burned to death while under the influence of this spell (+5 to casting roll; may affect up to one additional target).
Effects: Attracting the power of fire into themselves or unto another, the mage infuses his target with the unrestrained passion, zeal, and tireless persistence of his element. By heating the blood of the target to excruciating levels, the mage imbues them with supernatural toughness and the ability to shrug off wounds that would normally cause bleeding. Those under the influence of this spell automatically cauterize any open wound. Each round past the first since the casting of this spell requires the target to roll 1d10, causing them to take that much damage as their blood boils hotly and unnaturally for the duration of the spell. Additionally, the target of this spell gains 15 temporary hp per caster mp and gains high pain threshold at the maximum rank until the spell expires.
Duration: 3 rounds + caster MP
Range: Touch
Casting Time: 2 actions
Fluff: During a friendly competition between the fire and light colleges where each would demonstrate the practical medical usage of their wind, the mage Mendicron was called to represent the fire college as the leading expert in the abstract application of their element. His light mage competitor flaunted an effective, quick, and painless method of healing upon the test subject, leaving not even the slightest blemish upon their form. Mendicron stepped forth and applied his own spell that had taken weeks of preparation, study, and conceptual understanding. The victim loosed a deathly, blood curdling scream as their skin turned red hot and their veins bulged uncontrollably as though about to burst. The victim perished from the early incarnation of Mendicron’s spell, and thus the fire college admitted defeat in the competition. To comfort those that were forced to witness his fire to healing prototype, the lord magister offered some expert words of comfort: “Well, I’m sure if you take what is left of him you can recoup your loss, if any”. He was discredited shortly thereafter and fled the college.

Purified by Fire
Cost per Rank: 2
Casting Number: 15
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 8
Reagents: The bottled essence of a demon or spirit that has possessed before (caster uses their willpower x5 + double their spell ranks vs the demon/spirit).
Effects: The mage wraps the soul of a possessed person or creature in searing flame, causing them extreme spiritual agony over time whilst seeking to burn out foreign influences that may be possessing them (demons, spirits, etc). Whilst under the influence of the spell, the target and the caster gain 5 insanity per minute they remain under the incantation, suffering immeasurable pain as the caster and the influence within them battle for their soul. When cast upon the target, the mage and the demon/spirit/etc. engage in a battle of wills, rolling competitive checks vs each other for a number of rounds equal to the casters MP. The mage uses their Willpower + spell ranks vs the willpower of the influence in question, gaining a +5 bonus each round past the first (should they not be successful initially) as the spirit or demon is flayed from within by agonizing fire. Each competitive check made during the spell counts as 1 minute passing for the purposes of gaining insanity. Success on the part of the caster frees the target from any demonic/spirit influence and renders them immune to possession by that same demon/spirit for the rest of their lifespan. Failure renders the demon/spirit immune to this spell and it remains within its host. Additionally, if the demon doubles the competitive willpower check of the caster, the spell fails immediately and the caster gains 5 insanity x their MP.
Duration: Until checks equal to the casters MP are exhausted
Range: Touch

Damage: 50 per round
Effects: Clasping his hands together, the pyromancer opens them to pour forth a brightly burning beam of white-hot fire, cutting through stone, iron, and flesh as easily as a hot knife through butter. Can be targeted to specific limbs or body locations at a -5 penalty for limbs and a -10 penalty for heads, however opponents can attempt to avoid shots by rolling dodge vs. the casting number of the spell; shots that hit will crit as normal. Bypasses through and melts armor. Cuts through solid objects such as stone walls or gates virtually instantly, and without significant reduction in damage.

Airburst
Cost per Rank: 6

Damage: 50 within 25m, 25 within 50m, 10 within 100m
Effects: his arcane chanting building to a rapid crescendo, the pyromancer claps his hands and the sky opens up into a massive burning fireball, blasting apart all those caught nearby; those caught in the AOE also check for being knocked down; those within 25m have a strength DC30 to resist, those within 50m have a DC20 to resist, and those within 100m have a strength DC10 to resist.

Curse of Clinging Flame
Cost per Rank: 3
Casting Number: 14
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 10
Reagents: a pot of tar (duration is increased to 1 hour before the spell must be sustained); the crisped skin of a Black Magister (curse is permanent)
Effects: the pyromancer curses his foe to die by fire; those cursed will always take the worse of 2 rolls for ignite checks for the duration, and suffer a penalty to these rolls equal to the MP of the caster; also, if they are ignited, attempts to put it out for the duration are useless (the fire is magical and will even burn underwater)
Range: 20m, line of sight
Duration: minutes equal to caster MP, then sustained at 1WP/minute
Casting Time: 1

Flamewalk
Cost per Rank: 5
Casting Number: 25
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 10
Reagents: shoes belonging to a coal-walker (+10 to casting roll); a bottle of pure inert gas (no need to check for ignite).
Effects: briefly transmuting his essence into pure fire, the pyromancer leaps into a fire and travels through the world as a thread of Aqshy before reforming at another blaze of sufficient proportions; by leaping into a blaze large enough to encompass the pyromancer (curled up into a ball if necessary), he may emerge at any other blaze within the range; however, if he cannot see the other blaze, he rolls 1d10 for insanity points as he is forced to traverse through the Aethyr looking for the nearest glow of Aqshy; casting this spell without having a blaze nearby to teleport to merely results in the caster coming back through the fire he left through, although the time spent looking around similarly means he must roll 1d10 for insanity points; casters check for ignite as normal when they enter and exit a blaze, unless they are already shielded against it (such as with Aqshy’s Aegis or Shield of Aqshy)
Range: line of sight, max 1km
Casting Time: 1 action

Banking the Blaze
Cost per Rank: 2
Casting Number: 8
Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 3
Reagents: a fistful of ash, packed around a lump of charcoal taken from the heart of a fire (spell can be delayed for 1 day per caster MP at no cost)
Effects: the caster calms the winds of Aqshy surrounding a blaze, causing them to subside until they are nothing but tiny embers, until they too wink out; however, like a fire that smoulders underground through the winter, the flames can come back if the pyromancer wills it; snuff all flames within the AOE immediately; for those of a magical nature, the casting roll of Banking the Blaze must beat the casting roll of the target spell’s flames (exception: flames caused by a spell previously cast by the same caster who is now casting Banking the Blaze). During the duration of the spell, the flames can be brought back with the same force they were burning previously with a thought; however, if they are not brought back within the duration of the spell, then they remain put out.
Range: 5m/caster MP
AOE: 5m/caster MP
Casting Time: 1 action

Damage: upon death, use Fiery Blast; upon rebirth, use Firestorm, lasting for 1 round
Effects: the mage encases his soul and essence within an carefully constructed shell of Aqshy, allowing him to be reborn 1 day later if he is killed him combat; once cast, the spell cannot be cast again until 1 year later; upon death, the pyromancer explodes outwards in a fiery torrent, and upon rebirth he immolates all around him in a mighty hurricane of fire; death must be caused by damage, rather than spell effects (such as spells which instantly kill someone or turn them to stone, crystal, or gold, or remove their soul); the magister’s gear is left undamaged, but does not go with him; upon rebirth, he appears naked and covered in ash on the spot that he died, and rolls 1d10; on a 1-5 death takes its toll upon his body and mind, causing a penalty of -1 to all attributes (permanent, but they can be bought back) and the user gains 2d10 insanity; on a 6-10, he is reborn with only 2 attribute points lost and may choose which ones, and only gains 1d10 insanity

Damage: 5 damage per round
Effects: you cloak yourself in the fire of Aqshy, absorbing and nullifying any fire that touches you; the caster and any who link hands or otherwise maintain contact with the caster or one who is sharing the Aegis with him are enveloped in a bright fiery shield that prevents any damage from fire harming them, and immolates any foolish enough to approach them

Range: self, touch (touch must be maintained throughout the duration)
Area of Effect: 5m radius from caster and those sharing the Aegis

Casting Number: 26
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 10
Reagents: an Ogre’s spleen (double damage, +15 to contested willpower rolls)
Damage: 40/round
Effects: you force a flood of Aqshy through your target’s veins, heating their blood to a rolling boil within seconds and causing them to suffer pain of the most excruciating kind and explode in a steaming torrent of viscera; make a contested willpower check with the target, using your MP and spell ranks as modifiers; on a fail the spell deals only 20 damage, and then fizzes out; on a success the spell acts as normal, and the target (assuming they survive the first round) must pass a pain check with willpower DC 50 to take any further actions as they are boiled form the inside out; if they are killed by this spell or while under it’s effect, they explode, their pressurized boiling remains dealing 1d10 damage to all targets within a 5m radius

Effects: you breathe forth a gout of clinging magical flame on to your opponents like the dragons of yore, incinerating them; all designated targets auto-ignite; flames travel around most cover and ignore shields and armor, finding their way through cracks; 1 target per caster MP, and damage can be concentrated to a proportion desired by the caster
Range: 5 meters per caster MP

The Burning Head
Cost per Rank: 7
Casting Number: 41

Damage: 200 (line) 50 (AOE)
Effects: the caster creates a spectral flaming skull and fires it forth into the battlefield like a mighty cannonball; the scream it shrieks as it homes forth towards its target burns the very souls of all who hear it, causing all within triple the AOE to gain 1d10 insanity points and make a fear check with DC30 or flee the battlefield; it smashes through targets before it much as a cannonball would do, except that it is unaffected by inertia and even those near its path are blasted backwards by the fire of its wake, taking falling damage as determined by the GM; the cannonball seeks its target and deals an additional 100 damage (totalling to 300 damage) with a 50m AOE (dealing 100 damage) on impact; all within the AOE of the detonation or the wake must make checks for ignite
Range: line of sight, up to 1km

Effects: you inflame another person’s ill humors, causing them to become irrationally angry at a person you designate; both must be within line of sight to each other; make a contested willpower check against the target, including your MP and spell ranks as modifiers; for every degree of 10 that you beat your target, they suffer a -10 to will checks to resist the effects of the spell over time; if you succeed, they begin immediately acting aggressively and angry towards the designated character and must make a willpower check with DC equal to 20 to resist attacking the designated character for the duration of the spell

Effects: the pyromancer gathers unto himself a raging infernal hurricane of Aqshy, which spirals out around him gaining strength and power as it utterly destroys and incinerates all around it; fire from the Conflagration of Doom deals 5 damage per round to the caster, directly to his soul; this damage is incredibly painful and the caster must make a pain check with DC20 increasing by 5 per round to continue casting this spell; this damage cannot be avoided or prevented, and takes 5x the normal amount of time to heal; however, it is capable of melting even gromril and boils metal, renders air to plasma, and utterly destroys everything around it if allowed to build sufficiently (GM’s discretion); the caster is protected from the mundane effects of the fire around him and does not take additional damage from this, but any equipment he is carrying or wearing is destroyed by the spell. All targets within triple the AOE of the spell must check for immolation. The fire is infused with the destructive essence of Aqshy and is capable of harming spirits, daemons, and even dragons. Due to the inherently dangerous and destructive nature of this spell, it is taught to only the most powerful and strong-minded and hale-bodied battle mages of the Bright College, and it disrupts magic all around it in a 10km radius, causing all magisters attempting to cast there to suffer -10 to their casting rolls for the next month. Because of the highly disruptive and destructive effect of this spell on the winds of magic, spells attempting to target or affect the pyromancer casting Conflagration of Doom suffer a stacking -10 penalty to their casting roll per round (-20 the second round, -30 the third round, etc)
Duration: maintained at 25/round

Damage: 5 per round
Effects: you fan the flames of rage within a man’s soul, charging their muscles with the fury of Aqshy and filling their minds with a reckless burning hatred but this hatred also burns them visibly from the outside in (their skin smokes and small flames and sparks shoot out from their form); highly flammable materials within 1m of the target have a chance of igniting (straw, paper, alcohol, oil, etc.), but the target gains +1 strength (including the temporary HP gained from it), 2 free actions, and Fearless, but also gain Berserk and Bloodlust and must attack the nearest living target, friend or foe, for the duration of the spell; Willpower DC 25 to resist; characters that gain Berserk from this spell reduce their number of defensive actions per round to 1; strength increased by this spell is capped at 6, and this cap may not be altered

Damage: 25/round
Effects: all who contact the fire must make a check for ignite, and suffer full damage unless they make an initiative check with DC25 to avoid the flame should it spring up underneath them; the flame is magical and simply running through it quickly (such as passing a flame through a candle quickly) will not mitigate the damage; the damage also ignores armor
Duration: minutes equal to the caster’s MP, then maintained at 3WP/round
Range: line of sight, 50m
Area of Effect: 30 cubic meters per caster MP, in the form of a contiguous wall curved or bent as the caster likes; can be modified after it is cast, however this requires another casting roll is required should the caster wish to do this after spell has already been cast

Effects: the caster blows a torrent of Aqshy upon a flame, fanning it to its maximum potential without snuffing it out; at its simplest, raging bonfires can be started from dying coals and a candle can light up a mansion; however, many pyromancers use this to ensure that their foes burn up with satisfying alacrity. Every round, the rate at which a fire is burning exponentially increases (doubling); double ignite effects every round; however, fuel is consumed accordingly quickly, and unless the supply of fuel is kept full it will be consumed very quickly it the mage continues to fan the flames with magic

Effects: the pyromancer forces together a length of Aqshy, sharpened to a killing point and shaped into a blade; it has a penetration of 8 and causes targets to check for ignite, with their check DC stacking by 1 for every additional time they are hit; the pyromancer uses his MP, Willpower and spell ranks as his skill base for using the sword, but for all other intents and purposes it is treated like a longsword; it can harm daemons and spirits as normal, and they ignite automatically upon being struck; the sword also glows like a torch and casts similar illumination as well as being capable of igniting things similar to how a torch would

Effects: you cause 1 serving of food to instantly become fully cooked, or bring 1 litre of water to a rolling boil; spoiled or tainted food cooked this way becomes safe to eat (the ill effects thereof are cooked off) though they will not taste particularly pleasant; food cooked this way will improve their quality by 1 degree, becoming magically “fingerlickin’ good”; however, the caster must also roll 1d10 and on a 1-5 the food becomes extremely spicy (which the caster doesn’t mind but others might, and for which others may suffer … gastrointestinal distress)

Special note: those who are so inherently extremely “pure” or “good” as determined by the GM are unaffected by this curse (i.e. a true and pious high priest of Shallya). Also, it has been rumored that the curse has been removed in the past by kidnapping a young lady and getting her to fall in love with you ;)

Transformation of Kadon
Cost per Rank: 8

Minimum MP req: 5

Reagents: a tooth from the beast you wish to take the form of (+25 to casting roll), a full pint of blood from the beast the Shaman intends to transform into mixed with a pinch of warpstone (gain 1d10 mutation points and a single permanent beneficial mutation from the particular beast you intend to transform into, rolling a 1d10, exploding, to determine potency and usefulness, with higher being better).
Damage: GM`s discretion, based on the form taken
Effects:  Kadon was a master of forms, able to shift his shape to that of any monster. One day he found he could not change back. Let this be a warning to any that would attempt to misuse the power of greater shapeshifting; upon a success, the caster takes the form of any beast or monster of their choosing, up to the size of a dragon; examples are are Greater Manticores, Chimaeras, Shoggoths, Wyverns, Dragons, Krakens, Hydras, or massive forms of natural beasts such as a dragon-sized bear; the caster can choose to also take on the inherent magical powers of said monsters or beasts (such as a dragon`s fire, a wyvern`s venom, a Hydra`s regeneration, or a Shoggoth`s lightning affinity , but if they do so they gain berserk and bloodlust, and must successfully re-cast the spell to end the form or they are trapped in it forever). Spells can be cast while transformed, but reagents cannot be used and all casting rolls suffer a -10 and casters are limited to maximum 1 spell per turn. Casters of this spell must have working knowledge of the form they wish to undertake (such as having seen or studied in detail the beast in question), or they cannot access the innate magical abilities of the beast, and they must roll 1d10; on a 1-5 they gain 1d10 insanity points and 1d10 mutation points, and on a 6-10 they gain neither but cannot use the transformation again without gaining 10 of each every time the spell is cast.

Effects: you enter a state of meditation; for the duration of the spell, you are immobile and cannot sense anything around you normally, and cannot cast other spells (although you may return to your body anytime by cancelling the spell); roll an intelligence check to sense all nearby animals (including humans and humanoid creatures like elves, dwarves, orcs, goblins, etc.), and then a contested willpower check to inhabit that creature for hours equal to your MP; inhabiting humanoid creatures with rudimentary intelligence (such as orcs, goblins, trolls, ogres, giants, other humans, elves, dwarves, etc.) is possible, but their contested willpower check allows an additional 1d10 to be rolled for them, and a successful possession will still cause you to roll 1d10 for insanity points each time; inhabiting chaos creatures will additionally cause the caster to roll 1d10 for mutation points as the essence of chaos rubs off on their soul; note: inhabiting the bodies of other humans is considered a serious taboo among wizards of the Amber College, and can result in expulsion and summary execution if discovered; inhabiting humanoid creatures with rudimentary intelligence is considered a disgusting act similar to bestiality, but is technically permitted. If the caster’s body is killed while skinwalking, he begins a second life within the body of the animal he was inhabiting; if the animal is killed during skinwalking, a Willpower check with DC 40 is required or you gain 1d10 insanity points and pass out for that many hours.

Effects: cackling with wicked glee, the hedgewizard places an evil hex upon his victim, causing them to suffer from exceptionally bad luck; once per day, at the GM’s discretion, something will go incredibly wrong for the target (as if a fate point had been expended against them, though not necessarily with fatal results); this can only be avoided by expending a fate point.

Upon a successful casting the target forgets the last 3~5 seconds (the casting of the spell). Depending on how the conversation goes and what is said the spells social benefits can become lasting at spells end (the target is more accepting of you and if you act in a friendly way that they would otherwise be responsive to they regard you as a friend at spells end. If you attempt to persuade them to do something they find repulsive or offensive the bonuses become negative on any further persuasion rolls with that NPC.

Magic Tattoo:
Cost per Rank: 8
Casting Number: 25
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 20
Reagents: A small bottle of ink and a sharp needle (required for spell)
Effects: Imbue a magical tattoo upon the skin of the target, containing within it the essence of a spell. The intended spell must be cast first, and delayed, and then the tattoo spell must be cast (thus entrapping the previous spell within the tattoo). The Tattoo will appear magical in nature to any with the ability to detect an enchantment. The spell can be cast multiple times on the same target, but each additional casting increases the cost by 1.5x if it is cast on a magic user, and by 3x if cast on a mundane being. Additionally, multiple castings must be done in the same sitting; once the tattoos are complete, additional ones cannot be cast until the existing ones are used up. Tattoos may be triggered by any magical being in the area, or by a non-magical being so long as they are the carrier of the tattoo. Triggering the tattoo takes the same number of mental actions that it took to cast the spell imbued within it, and if an outside influence attempts to trigger a tattoo on a magic user, then they must first succeed a contested willpower check against said user. All rolls to determine spell success are rolled upon the creation of the tattoo and stored until triggered. Numerical values of the spell are rolled upon triggering the spell. Using a tattoo will cause the ink to visibly fade away from the skin, and the use of tattoos by non-magical beings or by spellcasters whose MP is lower than the MP of a spell inscribed into a tattoo on them requires a willpower check equal to 10 x the minimum MP req of the spell, or they gain 2d10 insanity points, 2d10 mutation points, and the spell goes haywire and functions in a manner of the GM’s choice.
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Range: Touch
Casting Time: hours equal to the minimum MP req of the tattoo, stacking for each additional casting.

Razorwire Throne
Cost per Rank: 6
Casting Number: 33
Minimum MP req: 4
WP Cost: 40
Reagents: a garrotte (+5 to casting roll), a length of spiked chain covered in fresh blood (+10 to base damage)
Damage: 30 + 2d10 per round with penetration 8 to ensnared opponents
Effects: Gathering the power of Dhar around him and chanting sibilant words of cruelty and torture, the dark mage conjures forth massive throne of razorwire to bear him aloft and ensnare his opponents in an agonizing, penetrating cage of spiked metal; allows the caster to move 40m per round and scale sheer surfaces, provides a protective layer of armor that grants soak 10 and deflection 8, and allows you to attempt to ensnare 1d10 opponents within 20m each round; they must make a dodge check vs a DC of 30, and if they fail they are ensnared and lifted off the ground, causing them suffer damage every round for the duration of the spell and preventing them from moving or taking any combat actions. A maximum of 10 opponents may be ensnared at any given time.
Duration: maintained at 10WP per round
Range: self
Area of Effect: 20m radius around caster for ensnaring
Casting Time: 1 minute

Wormtongue
Cost per Rank: 5
Casting Number: 25
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 12
Reagents: The tongue of a malicious royal advisor (increases the duration to 1 year per caster MP and allows the caster to take the better of two rolls versus all chosen targets).
Effects: The caster mutters arcane words of deceit and illusion, wrapping themselves in a blurred cloak of uncertainty that is visible only to those with magic potential. All targets the caster chooses within an aoe of himself must make a contested willpower check vs the casters willpower + mp + spell ranks + 2d10. Should the caster win the check, all chosen targets are considered ‘mind poisoned’ and are much more suggestable to all ideas presented to them by the caster. This bonus starts at +10 and may stack up to three times, giving a total bonus of +30 to all social rolls vs the targets. Every hour the caster remains in the presence of the chosen targets, they must roll a contested check as listed above. Each failure by the chosen targets adds an additional +10 social bonus to the caster and refreshes the duration. If an opponent succeeds their contested check vs the caster, then the social bonus (if any) decreases by -10 for that specific target. The caster may omit all chosen targets within the aoe from rechecking at any time. Characters coerced into doing things drastically against their nature may gain insanity points upon the completion of said action or deed.
Duration: 1 hour + 1 per caster MP.
Range: Self
Area of Effect: 5m + 5 per caster MP
Casting Time: 1 minute
Fluff: “Be silent worm! Keep your forked tongue between your teeth!”

Treacherous Sacrifice
Cost per Rank: 3
Casting Number: 14
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 10
Reagents: Tattered clothing of a betrayed companion (+5 to casting roll and contested willpower check).
Effects: The caster summons a foul torrent of treacherous dark energy, directing it to wrap around and strangle the life from an ally, converting 50% of their maximum HP into WP for the caster. This spell may only be cast if it would kill the ally in question and will have no effect otherwise; targets with more than 10% of their health remaining are immune to this spell and may not be targeted. The target of this spell must pass a contested willpower check vs the willpower of the caster. Failing this, they are dissolved into magical essence that seeps into the caster, replenishing their WP pool (if the amount of WP recovered exceeds the mages total pool, the excess dissipates from their pool at the end of combat or 5 minutes + 5 per caster MP if not in combat). Success causes the spell to fail and no effect to take place; the target becomes immune to treacherous sacrifice for the rest of the scene.
Range: 5 meters + 5 per caster MP
Casting Time: 2 actions.

Black Quiet
Cost per Rank: 3
Casting Number: 18
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 10
Reagents: A buckle from the straightjacket of an infamous madman (increase the insanity multiplier to 10x caster MP); half of a mages tongue (+5 to casting roll; silence lasts 4x casters MP).
Effects: The mage lashes out at his target with a vision of absolute dread, causing them to become overwhelmed by terror, frozen in place with their mouth agape in fear (the target rolls a willpower check against the casting roll of this spell; success causes the spell to have no effect). If the target of this spell is a mage (and they fail their initial willpower check), they are silenced (unable to cast spells) for a number of rounds equal to the caster’s MP. As an additional effect of this spell, the target gains 5x the MP of the caster worth of insanity points upon failing their willpower check. For days equal to the MP of the caster, invisible strands of dark magic sew shut the mouth of the target (giving a -10 penalty to spell casting attempts and preventing speech for the duration).
Duration: Silence (1 round per caster MP), Speechless (1 day per caster MP), and terror (1 round).
Range: 15 meters + 5 per caster MP
Casting Time: 2 actions

Detect Thoughts:
Cost per Rank: 8
Casting Number: 30
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 12; 2/min upkeep
Reagents: A page from a book on philosophy (+10 to casting roll)
Damage: N/A
Effects: Allows you to passively read the thoughts of those around you or actively read a specific targets surface thoughts. Succeeding the Casting number by 10 or more can allow you to probe a target's mind to attempt to dig up information but doing so allows them a DC 25 intelligence check to realize you're doing so, upon success they will look directly at you and know exactly what you were doing. Competitive willpower checks to extract any information past this point if you lose by more than 10 on a single roll the spell is disrupted. Reading thoughts can be more dangerous than advantageous (possible insanity from reading the wrong thought). Caution should be executed.
Duration: 10 minutes; 2wp/min their after
Range: Self
Area of Effect: 15m per MP
Casting Time: 3

Invisibility:
Cost per Rank: 7
Casting Number: 18
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 14
Reagents: A pair of fresh human eyeballs (+10 casting roll). A dark cloak or robe (+10min/Mp duration). A dagger once belonging to a famous rogue (able to attack and use items / spells as normal without breaking invisibility)
Damage: N/A
Effects: Renders caster invisible to normal sight; dispelled at first mention of aggressive behaviour (no free attack, the target will have time to dodge or parry if they have their weapon drawn. drawing a bow counts to break invisibility as would channeling a spell); encompasses the caster`s clothes and objects they are carrying at the time of casting
Duration: maintained at 3WP per min
Range: self
Area of Effect: none
Casting Time: 4 actions

Warp Step:
Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 16

WP Cost: 5
Reagents: A throwing dagger which can be thrown to the location desired as part of the casting process (+throwing dagger weapon skill to casting roll)
Effects: Moves you 5m per MP in one direction. Requires line of sight (but not necessary free movement to that location) (aka, through iron bars); Roll DC 30 Will save, on a fail gain 1d10 insanity.
Range: Self
Casting Time: 1 action

Curse of Vanity
Cost per Rank: 4.
Casting Number: 26.
Minimum MP req: 3.
WP Cost: 25.
Reagents: A thorned white rose from a forbidden garden (apply the curse to a single extra individual; duration changes to permanent) or a lock of hair from a vain individual (changes the range of the spell from touch to 15 meters).
Effects: You curse a target to have an incredibly unhealthy infatuation with themselves to the point of delusion. Failing a competitive willpower check vs the caster with mp and spell ranks as a modifier cause the target to become stunned for a number of hours equal to the mp of the caster as they become lost in the beauty of their form. Whenever a character with curse of vanity upon them catches a glimpse of their own reflection, they must succeed a variable DC check based on the clarity of said reflection (DC 25 for clear water, DC 35 for a mirror being examples). Should the image being admired be obstructed, removed, or the character somehow distanced from it, they act as though they have bad temper at its highest level toward the cause. This spell gains a +10 or +20 modifier to the casting roll if the character possesses the vanity flaw.
Duration: 1 month.
Range: Touch.
Casting Time: 4 actions.
Fluff: Lanis Couteau was a noblewoman renowned for her self-obsession. One fateful day a suitor happened upon her thin, malnourished form sprawled across the bed with a bewildered look plastered upon her face, eyes unnaturally wide in amazement. Apparently starvation was a fitting alternative to turning away from the mirror.

Barbed Noose of Cruel Strangulation
Cost per Rank: 3.
Casting Number: 15.
Minimum MP req: 2.
WP Cost: 5.
Reagents: A noose shaped from a dead thorn branch (+5 to casting roll); The branch of an evil thorn bush that has killed a man (spell is granted a 20m radius and affects all targets within the aoe; suspends targets in the air with strength equal to 2x MP).
Damage: 5 initial magic damage (+1d10 each time the target fails a strength check).
Effects: You summon a magical, viciously thorned noose that materializes around the neck of a single target, immediately tightening to deal an initial 5 magical damage. The noose slowly drags the victim into the air (with str equal to the mp of the caster), causing the them to enter a bleed state while being strangled/pierced by barbs. Each round that passes causes the target to enter a new tier of bleeding as the noose continues to pierce and tear into their flesh as they struggle (roll 1d10 for damage each round that passes while the target is still under the effects of the noose). For the duration of this spell, the target is able to make as many strength checks to free themselves as they have strength (starting DC of 15 + MP + spell ranks, with the DC increasing by 5 each round). Upon exhausting the number of checks allowed by their total strength the character will fall unconscious (the target is killed if they endure a similar duration again whilst unconscious). Succeeding a strength check allows the target to ‘break’ the noose and free themselves from the spell. Targets under the effects of the noose count as immobilized and silenced (cannot cast spells) until it is removed, indicating them being pulled off of their feet and strangled (unable to properly speak).
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 per MP.
Range: 20 meters (line of sight required).
Casting Time: 2 actions.
Fluff: Being hung for the tiniest transgressions wasn’t an uncommon occurrence in many places. Being cruelly hung for them was.

Voice of a Thousand Needles
Cost per Rank: 3.
Casting Number: 14.
Minimum MP req: 2.
WP Cost: 5.
Reagents: The jaw of an evil creature or being (+3 to casting roll; spell lasts 1 hour per mp instead of minutes); the black heart of a notorious overlord (spell becomes permanent, the base DC is increased to 25, and the degree of failure requirement is decreased to every 5; the intimidate bonus is increased to +8 (and +14, respectively); the voice is now heard by all within range and no longer allows selected targets).
Effects: You alter your voice to sound incredibly evil, demonic, or somehow terrifying to all chosen targets (number equal to MP) who would hear you speak. So extreme is this change that all chosen targets within hearing range must make a fear check equal to DC: 15 + caster mp + spell ranks or flee as though they suffered from a high level phobia (those who cannot flee operate as though they had a high level phobia of the caster for the remainder of the scene; they must roll 2d10 for insanity each scene they remain captive as long as they hear the altered voice of the caster). For each degree of 10 a target fails their willpower check, they gain 1d10 insanity points divided by 2 (rounded up) and take 1d10 damage (divided by 2, rounded down), as the sound is enough to scar their very mind and soul. While under the effects of Voice of a Thousand Needles, the caster also gains a +5 bonus to their intimidate checks (+10 if the target cannot elude or escape the scene and has failed their willpower check), even against those that have succeeded their fear check.
Duration: 1 minute per caster MP.
Range: self
Area of Effect: audible range.
Casting Time: 1 action.
Fluff: Initially, Marco Salverette was unwilling to cooperate with the sinister demands of the dark mage Tarconis Plat. Using some manner of advanced negotiating technique, Plat changed his mind rather quickly, a surprising development given Marco’s well documented stubbornness.

Ethereal Chains
Cost per Rank: 4.
Casting Number: 22.
Minimum MP req: 3.
WP Cost: 5 per chain.
Reagents: A chain link forged from the rarest magical metal (chains become permanent, have no maintain cost, have their damage increased by 25 each, and deal full damage to demons, spirits, etc.); a 5 meter long iron chain (+3 to casting roll and reduce wp cost by 1).
Damage: 5 magic damage (per chain if used to attack).
Effects: Summons ethereal chains that whip forth into existence from behind the caster, each with four sharp claws (capable of gripping/grabbing objects) that may assist them in combat or other activities that require multiple physical actions. This spell allows the caster to summon a number of chains equal to their MP (with strength equal to this as well), each with 1 physical action per round and strength equal to the mp of the caster. Attacks or checks made using the chains are done using the mp of the caster + spell ranks + 2d10 and cannot be parried due to their ghostly properties. When used in combat the chains take their actions separately from the caster and do not count against them when determining total mental/physical actions. Using the chains to perform specific actions however will consume a mental action per chain used. Each chain has a length equal to 5 meters per MP, but they may be shorter if the caster so wishes.
Duration: Maintained at 2 wp per round (past the first round).
Range: Self.
Casting Time: 1 action per chain
Fluff: “Some are born to climb, others are carried”.

Crowley’s Fireball:
Cost per Rank: 5
Casting Number: 15
Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: none, however every time the spell is rolled, roll 1d10; on a 4 or below, gain 1 insanity point
Reagents: a page from the Book of Crowley (automatically gain 1 insanity point per casting, but decrease casting time to ½ an action and increase damage to 10 per fireball; effect is permanent)
Damage: 5+1d10 per fireball, 1 fireball per caster MP, ignores armour
Effects: through your studies of one of the most horribly broken dark mages ever to stalk the Old World, you have learned a way to cast a very specific type of fireball without fatiguing yourself in any way; however, doing so brings you further and further to the brink of madness as the tormented soul of Allistair Crowley stirs; ignites opponents (regardless of whether or not they are flammable) on 5 or above on a 1d10 roll (ignited opponents take 5 damage per turn and must make pain checks with willpower DC 30)
Range: 100M
Casting Time: 1 action

Reagent: a blade stained with its previous owners blood. Requirement: the weapon must be on or being held by the person who is being targeted; if it is a ranged weapon, it must be loaded (or double WP cost). The owner of the weapon may resist being attacked should they have combat reflexes or have reason to suspect being attacked by their own weapon (i.e. the spell has just been cast on them previously); to do so, a competitive strength check will be made if they are grasping the weapon, or a dodge check done against their own weapon skill with the weapon being used.

Cost per Rank: 4
Casting Number: 26
Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 10
Reagents: Dead flesh, bone, or organs (required); embalming fluid (+10 to casting roll)
Effects: Whispering dread syllables that numb his lips as they emerge from his tortured throat, the necromancer renders dead flesh soft and malleable as clay, and sculpts a masterpiece; allows the necromancer to attach additional limbs, flesh and onto an undead creature of their choosing, essentially creating a flesh golem; this functions by allowing the attachment of 1 full limb (this functions by granting a +5 bonus to brawling attacks), or 50HP of flesh (this requires half a body as a reagent), or an increase the strength attribute of the target by 1 point, to a maximum strength of 6 (this requires a full body as a reagent); other options exist, and are limited to the imagination of the caster and the permission of the GM (examples of this might include additional eyes to allow 360 degree vision, multiple tongues sewn together and embedded with sharpened shards of bone to allow for a lashing tongue attack, or additional limbs attached to existing ones to give a reach advantage). Each separate instance requires a separate casting roll.
Duration: permanent
Range: touch
Casting Time: 5 minutes to 1 hour (varies, depending on the type of attachment; increasing strength requires 1 hour)

Minimum MP req: 3
WP Cost: 15
Reagents: a sacrificial dagger (+10 to casting roll, WP cost reduced to 5), a glass phylactery (allows the soul to be trapped within, for later use)
Effects: Drawing forbidden sigils in the air above a freshly slaughtered body, the Necromancer rips its soul free and consumes it’s essence; allows the caster to harvest the soul of a dying (max 5HP left) or recently deceased (within 10 minutes) person, gaining their soul. The soul can be consumed like a “mana” potion, refilling the caster’s WP with points equivalent to 10x the sum of the person’s strength and willpower, or it can be used on a spell being casted within the next minute to add a bonus to the casting roll equal to 5x the higher of their strength or willpower. If not used or consumed within the next minute, the soul fades away and is lost.

Minimum MP req: 2
WP Cost: 1WP for every 2HP
Reagents: a fresh human brain (+5 to casting roll); a fresh human heart (grants bonus HP to the shield equal to half the HP of the person the heart came from)
Effects: waving clawed hands around him in a whirl, the necromancer summons forth the tortured spirits and ghosts of the nether realm, binding their agonized essence into a crude but effective shield around him; functions as a globe-shaped shield made of ghosts which soak up any damage that would otherwise hit the caster. Ignore penetration values of weapons attacking this shield, just use their raw damage. Weapons that would crit do not do so against this shield. Total shield HP is proportional to the amount of WP used to cast it, and once cast cannot be “charged” further unless it is re-cast. All physical and magical damage directed at the shield goes first to its HP, until the shield is worn out.
Duration: 1 hour, or until dispelled or shield HP run out.
Range: self
Area of Effect: a sphere sufficiently large to just barely encompass the caster.
Casting Time: 1 action

Raise Dead:
Cost per Rank: 3
Casting Number: 12
Minimum MP req: 1
WP Cost: 4
Reagents: a personal possession of the deceased (+10 to casting roll); a pound of putrid flesh (attacks from risen dead that damage opponents cause them to suffer an additional 5 + 1d10 damage per round for the next 5 rounds; targets roll to resist disease, with a DC of 20; being struck multiple times does not stack damage); the finger of a necromancer (those killed by risen dead themselves arise to join the army, free of charge; they last for the same duration as the ones which killed them)
Effects: The necromancer reaches into the realm of the dead and brings back the spirits of the dead, forcing them to walk again in their old mouldering bodies; causes a dead body (or skeletal remains) to be animated by its spirit in life, enslaved to the caster’s will. HP = ½ of what it had in life (but can be closer to full depending on how fresh the body is), and stats are similar to what it would have had in life, but with minimal intelligence (similar to a zombie or skeleton). Issuing commands to the risen dead takes ½ an action, but they can be “programmed” with basic instructions (such as patrol this area and attack anything that comes by, or follow behind me but remain hidden at the side of the road, etc.)
Duration: hours equal to caster MP + spell ranks, then sustained at 1WP per hour per risen dead; can be “charged” with additional WP to run on “autopilot” while the caster rests or is off doing something else
Range: 10m per caster MP to cast, 1km per caster MP to sustain
Area of Effect: 10m radius per caster MP + spell ranks
